Perplexity : 966.0382178132173
Sentence: affectation of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where .
Perplexity : 962.7924332415994
Sentence: but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body 's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone .
Perplexity : 640.5039271241426

Perplexity : 333.6706399008773
Sentence: elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .
Perplexity : 759.8474955000461
Sentence: they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited .
Perplexity : 689.4214005479749
Sentence: mr. bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .
Perplexity : 898.1955777210613
Sentence: his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs. hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .
Perplexity : 872.5302512559099
Sentence: mr. bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house .
Perplexity : 842.8279318724949

Perplexity : 810.9487802346729
Sentence: between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .
Perplexity : 649.5748798689946
Sentence: bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .

Sentence: bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever .
Perplexity : 1006.5683289218942
Sentence: he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting .
Perplexity : 3311.8347083815133
Sentence: in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .
Perplexity : 335.9090827671306
Sentence: bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence .
Perplexity : 1454.3343391611147
Sentence: the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .
Perplexity : 579.7082641932258
Sentence: bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .
Perplexity : 971.5705289750664
Sentence: darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .
Perplexity : 1192.7735293574774
Sentence: miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .
Perplexity : 673.3748381900873

Perplexity : 448.358656181322
Sentence: miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .

Perplexity : 1212.389462391367
Sentence: the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .
Perplexity : 706.8436943928284
Sentence: it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .
Perplexity : 1095.4044069665592
Sentence: by nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at st. james 's had made him courteous .
Perplexity : 3662.3696132057034
Sentence: lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet .

Sentence: the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt , there can not be two opinions on that point . ''
Perplexity : 665.3359085607698

Perplexity : 272.1389041824003

Perplexity : 537.8992067986724
Sentence: `` miss bingley told me , '' said jane , `` that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .
Perplexity : 1115.1059267247288

Perplexity : 323.9681389939001
Sentence: `` i do not believe a word of it , my dear .
Perplexity : 375.66799725282783
Sentence: if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs. long .
Perplexity : 270.1209500667885
Sentence: but i can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise . ''
Perplexity : 671.0423369229176
Sentence: `` i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long , '' said miss lucas , `` but i wish he had danced with eliza . ''
Perplexity : 515.8358956059238
Sentence: `` another time , lizzy , '' said her mother , `` i would not dance with him , if i were you . ''
Perplexity : 885.3949331384968
Sentence: `` i believe , ma'am , i may safely promise you never to dance with him . ''
Perplexity : 1102.5756425840214
Sentence: `` his pride , '' said miss lucas , `` does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .
Perplexity : 1082.8212669774477
Sentence: if i may so express it , he has a right to be proud . ''
Perplexity : 460.7452129409589
Sentence: `` that is very true , '' replied elizabeth , `` and i could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . ''
Perplexity : 901.3659726109533
Sentence: `` pride , '' observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , `` is a very common failing i believe .
Perplexity : 1769.1275328521012
Sentence: by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .
Perplexity : 1074.4788817171595
Sentence: vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously .
Perplexity : 1957.9503437656203
Sentence: a person may be proud without being vain .
Perplexity : 641.9572430269902
Sentence: pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . ''
Perplexity : 785.1523176606689
Sentence: `` if i were as rich as mr. darcy , '' cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , `` i should not care how proud i was .
Perplexity : 542.2336867254344
Sentence: i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . ''
Perplexity : 1239.2893756374342
Sentence: `` then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , '' said mrs. bennet ; `` and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly . ''

Sentence: the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield .
Perplexity : 423.54169169183285
Sentence: the visit was returned in due form .
Perplexity : 579.0703855633784
Sentence: miss bennet 's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest .
Perplexity : 587.3318764622165
Sentence: by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother 's admiration .
Perplexity : 817.8291494093498
Sentence: it was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .
Perplexity : 612.7190362040793
Sentence: she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas .
Perplexity : 287.51732623707005
Sentence: `` it may perhaps be pleasant , '' replied charlotte , `` to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .
Perplexity : 571.6538414019333
Sentence: if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .
Perplexity : 589.8701348866276
Sentence: there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .
Perplexity : 603.4268635299707
Sentence: we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .
Perplexity : 658.6118928052568
Sentence: in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .
Perplexity : 1509.4664244381204
Sentence: bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . ''
Perplexity : 555.4464227402653
Sentence: `` but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .
Perplexity : 519.9864710443776
Sentence: if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . ''
Perplexity : 520.1779589410439
Sentence: `` remember , eliza , that he does not know jane 's disposition as you do . ''
Perplexity : 843.992546303536
Sentence: `` but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . ''
Perplexity : 558.8860974738683
Sentence: but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .
Perplexity : 967.5913752953168
Sentence: jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .
Perplexity : 429.4275221760068
Sentence: when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . ''
Perplexity : 563.4057101482052
Sentence: `` your plan is a good one , '' replied elizabeth , `` where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it .
Perplexity : 807.4648753188749
Sentence: but these are not jane 's feelings ; she is not acting by design .
Perplexity : 382.38976471696543
Sentence: as yet , she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .
Perplexity : 834.8373030329719
Sentence: she has known him only a fortnight .
Perplexity : 353.0659809776871
Sentence: she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .
Perplexity : 780.0851607762822
Sentence: this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . ''
Perplexity : 275.3281776383694
Sentence: `` not as you represent it .
Perplexity : 238.38091283745763
Sentence: had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . ''
Perplexity : 818.9071328655893
Sentence: `` well , '' said charlotte , `` i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .
Perplexity : 575.0613924602405
Sentence: happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .
Perplexity : 497.33193789901117
Sentence: they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . ''
Perplexity : 464.47545206800197
Sentence: `` you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .
Perplexity : 582.3872788187351
Sentence: occupied in observing mr. bingley 's attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .
Perplexity : 574.0086052871469
Sentence: mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .
Perplexity : 443.7405309105986
Sentence: to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .
Perplexity : 1614.5495180017508
Sentence: though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .
Perplexity : 935.8628499858337
Sentence: of this she was perfectly unaware ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .
Perplexity : 400.729806661397
Sentence: he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .
Perplexity : 585.1985588537812
Sentence: his doing so drew her notice .
Perplexity : 528.8966172035899
Sentence: it was at sir william lucas 's , where a large party were assembled .
Perplexity : 1014.9712888370069
Sentence: `` what does mr. darcy mean , '' said she to charlotte , `` by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? ''
Perplexity : 736.619478439306
Sentence: `` but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about .
Perplexity : 275.32904439885635
Sentence: `` with great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . ''
Perplexity : 457.7242605854236
Sentence: `` you are severe on us . ''
Perplexity : 305.0084239540586
Sentence: `` it will be her turn soon to be teazed , '' said miss lucas .
Perplexity : 514.1683853819601
Sentence: `` i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows . ''
Perplexity : 929.9009460996932
Sentence: `` you are a very strange creature by way of a friend !
Perplexity : 378.9900168788817
Sentence: always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !
Perplexity : 770.2200011040272
Sentence: after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .
Perplexity : 1326.3253452105491
Sentence: mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .
Perplexity : 1368.4084980082316
Sentence: elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .

Sentence: when you told mrs. bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ?

Perplexity : 370.79637755182677
Sentence: your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month .

Sentence: i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do . ''

Perplexity : 1567.6395192459167
Sentence: she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .
Perplexity : 437.90367622502527
Sentence: she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .

Perplexity : 502.06659496210233
Sentence: elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .
Perplexity : 668.179157810568
Sentence: he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .

Sentence: he was full of joy and attention .
Perplexity : 296.0745341053912

Perplexity : 1589.7539685707204

Perplexity : 897.6231276850889
Sentence: miss bingley 's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr. darcy 's progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .

Perplexity : 451.9976247654562
Sentence: she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , '' by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ?
Perplexity : 1750.72410978616
Sentence: i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . ''

Sentence: `` if you mean darcy , '' cried her brother , `` he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards . ''
Perplexity : 1164.2758873665966
Sentence: `` i should like balls infinitely better , '' she replied , `` if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .

Perplexity : 497.3593550158638

Sentence: miss bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .
Perplexity : 466.7049088182776

Perplexity : 431.9012015856279

Sentence: `` you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other 's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , i should be completely in your way ; and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire .

Perplexity : 199.95256909565046

Perplexity : 1029.7160912395175
Sentence: `` i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , '' said he , `` that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .

Sentence: the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .
Perplexity : 884.3892163880704

Sentence: if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once .
Perplexity : 679.9080524597925

Perplexity : 703.5850375287922
Sentence: but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcy 's pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr. denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , '' i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . ''
Perplexity : 867.3297427893549
Sentence: this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .
Perplexity : 1180.726907972619
Sentence: attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .
Perplexity : 4991.161589362221
Sentence: the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .
Perplexity : 1394.1223153155072

Sentence: the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .
Perplexity : 426.2653239879278

Perplexity : 334.6086410498339
Sentence: when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .
Perplexity : 832.9417264509776
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .
Perplexity : 985.1095927643041
Sentence: they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .
Perplexity : 641.7579502765935
Sentence: he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .
Perplexity : 497.2736992344452
Sentence: that reply will do for the present .
Perplexity : 253.20613091926606
Sentence: perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .

Sentence: one must speak a little , you know .
Perplexity : 733.0285743978753
Sentence: it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . ''
Perplexity : 649.2638446092486
Sentence: `` are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? ''
Perplexity : 851.5458593559522
Sentence: `` both , '' replied elizabeth archly ; `` for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .
Perplexity : 671.2331775333002
Sentence: we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . ''

Sentence: the effect was immediate .
Perplexity : 387.9659118678457
Sentence: a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .
Perplexity : 1824.254327767086
Sentence: at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , '' mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . ''
Perplexity : 1264.9942068773485

Sentence: darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .
Perplexity : 1061.327061639317

Perplexity : 596.0306439439039
Sentence: `` i can readily believe , '' answered he gravely , `` that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . ''
Perplexity : 941.2955400356946
Sentence: `` but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity . ''
Perplexity : 606.1656046233793
Sentence: she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy 's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .
Perplexity : 1331.8053329097866
Sentence: they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , '' so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !

Sentence: your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr. darcy 's steward .
Perplexity : 864.4496623508492
Sentence: let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr. darcy 's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner .
Perplexity : 1350.4720759556776
Sentence: i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame , that he can not bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .
Perplexity : 553.8953321039498
Sentence: i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ''
Perplexity : 1437.489224248009
Sentence: `` his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , '' said elizabeth angrily ; `` for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcy 's steward , and of that , i can assure you , he informed me himself . ''
Perplexity : 672.1279276395397
Sentence: `` i beg your pardon , '' replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .

Perplexity : 861.0362781778565
Sentence: jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .
Perplexity : 967.7009674843691
Sentence: elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane 's being in the fairest way for happiness .
Perplexity : 1124.1154908703109
Sentence: `` i want to know , '' said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister 's , `` what you have learnt about mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 749.558662577505
Sentence: but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ''
Perplexity : 425.3441831892803
Sentence: `` no , '' replied jane , `` i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you .
Perplexity : 527.6053966974697
Sentence: mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister 's , mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
Perplexity : 609.0238804791311
Sentence: i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr. darcy 's regard . ''
Perplexity : 648.203964090405
Sentence: `` mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself ? ''
Perplexity : 317.2335562614101
Sentence: `` no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton . ''
Perplexity : 272.43255266346455
Sentence: `` this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 321.982736029584
Sentence: i am perfectly satisfied .
Perplexity : 401.75251557719594
Sentence: but what does he say of the living ? ''
Perplexity : 257.92748769786675
Sentence: `` he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only . ''
Perplexity : 724.2199954183151
Sentence: `` i have not a doubt of mr. bingley 's sincerity , '' said elizabeth warmly ; '' but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
Perplexity : 475.20244996524474
Sentence: mr. bingley 's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before . ''
Perplexity : 766.1414967379618
Sentence: she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .
Perplexity : 652.2115944733066
Sentence: elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley 's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .
Perplexity : 803.3907182240275
Sentence: on their being joined by mr. bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr. collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
Perplexity : 711.1403795633514
Sentence: `` i have found out , '' said he , `` by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .

Sentence: i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine .
Perplexity : 593.2053538513726
Sentence: how wonderfully these sort of things occur !
Perplexity : 2674.9836588793814

Perplexity : 577.5530131191585
Sentence: i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .
Perplexity : 603.4932323717452

Perplexity : 280.44858334272044
Sentence: it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night . ''
Perplexity : 388.2140656977963
Sentence: elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr. darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .
Perplexity : 859.2979152711727
Sentence: you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty .
Perplexity : 761.1102890404438
Sentence: pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . ''
Perplexity : 1209.3190258132556
Sentence: and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .
Perplexity : 1147.6437449777727
Sentence: her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words `` apology , '' '' hunsford , '' and `` lady catherine de bourgh . ''
Perplexity : 901.9219546607957
Sentence: it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .
Perplexity : 329.11568223606804
Sentence: mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr. collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .
Perplexity : 1133.3204534099075
Sentence: mr. collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr. darcy 's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .
Perplexity : 1339.2399457189451
Sentence: mr. collins then returned to elizabeth .
Perplexity : 256.2135550686062
Sentence: `` i have no reason , i assure you , '' said he , `` to be dissatisfied with my reception .
Perplexity : 865.5642397495844
Sentence: he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine 's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .
Perplexity : 780.2140396699804
Sentence: it was really a very handsome thought .
Perplexity : 273.34106273327893
Sentence: upon the whole , i am much pleased with him . ''
Perplexity : 534.2052037994989
Sentence: as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .
Perplexity : 813.1643730617972
Sentence: her mother 's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .
Perplexity : 1050.5753574210717
Sentence: when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr. bingley .
Perplexity : 902.7269545473563
Sentence: it was an animating subject , and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .
Perplexity : 1068.4303291348326
Sentence: his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .
Perplexity : 647.9400670187874
Sentence: it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane 's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .
Perplexity : 822.2255571121163
Sentence: it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .
Perplexity : 566.0920863781438
Sentence: she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .
Perplexity : 1042.8013570072942
Sentence: in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother 's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy , who sat opposite to them .
Perplexity : 917.6576106859192
Sentence: her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .
Perplexity : 726.3521251814641
Sentence: `` what is mr. darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ?
Perplexity : 614.5267445361441
Sentence: i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . ''
Perplexity : 378.7324990031254
Sentence: `` for heaven 's sake , madam , speak lower .
Perplexity : 4197.121528133382
Sentence: what advantage can it be to you to offend mr. darcy ?
Perplexity : 309.8918907538135
Sentence: you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . ''

Sentence: the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .
Perplexity : 1308.4394939326776

Perplexity : 969.5908143560168
Sentence: elizabeth now began to revive .
Perplexity : 625.2771738752436
Sentence: but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .
Perplexity : 1217.2157655983056
Sentence: by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .
Perplexity : 1097.0811329238102
Sentence: elizabeth 's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .
Perplexity : 886.2222124013322
Sentence: elizabeth was in agonies .
Perplexity : 361.0155755206673

Sentence: she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night .
Perplexity : 1250.4170316166385

Perplexity : 2321.1392619884523
Sentence: you have delighted us long enough .
Perplexity : 468.2998612729514
Sentence: let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . ''
Perplexity : 438.88921405833094
Sentence: mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father 's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .
Perplexity : 1272.6630027818194
Sentence: others of the party were now applied to .
Perplexity : 294.8668726043641
Sentence: `` if i , '' said mr. collins , `` were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .
Perplexity : 1098.9694695635974
Sentence: i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .
Perplexity : 651.943909897556
Sentence: the rector of a parish has much to do .
Perplexity : 312.2300841601897
Sentence: in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .
Perplexity : 807.087293639182
Sentence: he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible .
Perplexity : 717.6141420987275
Sentence: and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .
Perplexity : 906.6300107360739
Sentence: i can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . ''
Perplexity : 518.0613081951446
Sentence: and with a bow to mr. darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .
Perplexity : 672.8530742762252
Sentence: many stared .
Perplexity : 929.9413968597642
Sentence: many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .
Perplexity : 1390.015809392477
Sentence: that his two sisters and mr. darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .
Perplexity : 1220.932792507817
Sentence: the rest of the evening brought her little amusement .
Perplexity : 336.6744783124159
Sentence: she was teazed by mr. collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .
Perplexity : 800.2339631796524
Sentence: he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .
Perplexity : 507.17513162282
Sentence: there was no arguing upon such a project .
Perplexity : 886.524669490109
Sentence: she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good naturedly engaged mr. collins 's conversation to herself .
Perplexity : 1137.2449595620974
Sentence: she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy 's farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .
Perplexity : 962.4344904165471
Sentence: she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham , and rejoiced in it .
Perplexity : 414.34211897957164
Sentence: the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .
Perplexity : 507.0641659598194

Perplexity : 957.0817204395421
Sentence: elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of `` lord , how tired i am ! ''
Perplexity : 900.6402063192248
Sentence: bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .
Perplexity : 1004.4569641604186
Sentence: mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months .
Perplexity : 1568.5262106583239
Sentence: of having another daughter married to mr. collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .

Perplexity : 865.9526677464962

Perplexity : 121.00344486631388
Sentence: elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment 's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .

Sentence: mrs. bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr. collins began .

Perplexity : 729.0588327329008
Sentence: the idea of mr. collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : '' my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .
Perplexity : 1117.7794519639508
Sentence: secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness .

Sentence: twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! )

Sentence: to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .
Perplexity : 1517.3800395326189
Sentence: mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs. bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .

Sentence: mr. collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .
Perplexity : 1116.556152049995
Sentence: this information , however , startled mrs. bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .

Perplexity : 462.946908279584
Sentence: if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . ''
Perplexity : 1385.9435763701833
Sentence: `` sir , you quite misunderstand me , '' said mrs. bennet , alarmed .
Perplexity : 2794.5723083654384

Perplexity : 492.8198916961524
Sentence: mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .

Sentence: `` i have not the pleasure of understanding you , '' said he , when she had finished her speech .

Sentence: `` an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth .
Perplexity : 1085.6209554192183
Sentence: from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .
Perplexity : 301.31581979847243
Sentence: elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs. bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .
Perplexity : 727.812064633902
Sentence: `` what do you mean , mr. bennet , by talking in this way ?
Perplexity : 1135.0945572211153

Perplexity : 552.5328332210646

Perplexity : 1226.363525141419
Sentence: though her manner varied however , her determination never did .
Perplexity : 1538.924019442196
Sentence: mr. collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .
Perplexity : 2308.8534873052736
Sentence: he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .
Perplexity : 617.5594484312359
Sentence: his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother 's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .
Perplexity : 518.6678969078382

Perplexity : 392.06982656301244
Sentence: `` aye , there she comes , '' continued mrs. bennet , `` looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way .
Perplexity : 1571.143612232374
Sentence: but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .

''
Perplexity : 1600.9492668645223
Sentence: elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr. collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .
Perplexity : 1091.393258457273
Sentence: in a doleful voice mrs. bennet thus began the projected conversation .
Perplexity : 1161.3499180510794

Sentence: collins ! ''

Perplexity : 1071.1035512130782
Sentence: as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .
Perplexity : 1753.3434081531495
Sentence: he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .
Perplexity : 870.9995395783005

Perplexity : 1255.1840179289977
Sentence: she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .
Perplexity : 1187.7857488575357
Sentence: his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .
Perplexity : 504.73776917659774
Sentence: soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately .

Sentence: jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .
Perplexity : 855.2167672319758

Sentence: `` i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .

Sentence: i depend on you for that . ''
Perplexity : 148.9133400736037
Sentence: to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley 's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .

Perplexity : 680.7458491636348
Sentence: my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister 's partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman 's heart .

Perplexity : 181.59409709068953
Sentence: we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way .
Perplexity : 893.3147074222418
Sentence: but , my dearest jane , you can not seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend .

Perplexity : 953.716103067928
Sentence: after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .

Perplexity : 605.0846616829757

Perplexity : 1118.9758926865477
Sentence: such was miss lucas 's scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon .

Perplexity : 594.6747195954126
Sentence: the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .

Sentence: but still he would be her husband .
Perplexity : 216.76117936503763
Sentence: without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .
Perplexity : 1509.9859970533057
Sentence: this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .
Perplexity : 959.0214523441892
Sentence: the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .
Perplexity : 838.3411914916193
Sentence: elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .
Perplexity : 770.3203079726103
Sentence: she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr. collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .
Perplexity : 622.4602411051445
Sentence: a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .
Perplexity : 1609.9664392820891
Sentence: as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs. bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .
Perplexity : 607.8791269507226
Sentence: `` my dear madam , '' he replied , `` this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . ''

Sentence: `` you can not be too much on your guard .
Perplexity : 269.9966841162392
Sentence: risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . ''

Sentence: with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .
Perplexity : 725.3496156622036
Sentence: she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her 's , he might become a very agreeable companion .
Perplexity : 873.635587499695
Sentence: miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before .
Perplexity : 765.0518953776873
Sentence: the possibility of mr. collins 's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , '' engaged to mr. collins !
Perplexity : 790.2522659882188
Sentence: my dear charlotte , impossible ! ''
Perplexity : 1685.149002705807
Sentence: the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , '' why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ?
Perplexity : 1753.7764263384997
Sentence: do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman 's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? ''
Perplexity : 587.9129213721933
Sentence: but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .
Perplexity : 873.6752497531608
Sentence: `` i see what you are feeling , '' replied charlotte , `` you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you .
Perplexity : 1039.950387230643
Sentence: but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done .

Sentence: elizabeth quietly answered `` undoubtedly ; '' and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .
Perplexity : 602.635067923805
Sentence: charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .
Perplexity : 571.1932847878422
Sentence: it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .
Perplexity : 407.0979168371392
Sentence: she had always felt that charlotte 's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .
Perplexity : 868.1564927059992
Sentence: charlotte the wife of mr. collins , was a most humiliating picture !
Perplexity : 1024.5449115043298
Sentence: and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .
Perplexity : 576.9756042012746
Sentence: elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .
Perplexity : 1155.6020712058757
Sentence: with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , '' good lord !
Perplexity : 3089.380516359467
Sentence: sir william , how can you tell such a story ?
Perplexity : 1407.800484639156
Sentence: do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 368.06972276527574
Sentence: nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william 's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .
Perplexity : 810.8098673069745
Sentence: elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr. collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .
Perplexity : 996.8108729314317
Sentence: mrs. bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .
Perplexity : 750.4912233751503
Sentence: in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .
Perplexity : 936.5459097544407
Sentence: two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .
Perplexity : 978.6140803906146
Sentence: nothing could console and nothing appease her .
Perplexity : 684.9398831289861
Sentence: a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .
Perplexity : 1067.1347883390483
Sentence: mr. bennet 's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !
Perplexity : 1108.7937214190458
Sentence: lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs. bennet 's sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .
Perplexity : 807.202623537437
Sentence: between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .
Perplexity : 742.827149984714
Sentence: jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .
Perplexity : 876.6081007299335
Sentence: the promised letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth 's abode in the family might have prompted .
Perplexity : 933.68822120422
Sentence: after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .
Perplexity : 1207.2871063678729
Sentence: on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .
Perplexity : 271.31733276232507

Perplexity : 613.4944942535902
Sentence: day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .
Perplexity : 934.0285352473535
Sentence: even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .
Perplexity : 461.2748008486335

Perplexity : 1091.2534566123927
Sentence: but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .
Perplexity : 1171.4246835649608
Sentence: it needed all jane 's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .
Perplexity : 1600.9327162015975

Perplexity : 1291.1989127068605

Sentence: she complained bitterly of all this to her husband .
Perplexity : 461.8075851887507

Perplexity : 958.5909053532106
Sentence: elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin 's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .

Perplexity : 1240.5239115949946

Perplexity : 933.3252246267045

Perplexity : 1518.3768162381575
Sentence: it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before .

Perplexity : 628.1062017225315
Sentence: `` if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .
Perplexity : 603.5012945759697
Sentence: but perhaps mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . ''
Perplexity : 438.4450270846568
Sentence: `` i should not be surprised , '' said darcy , `` if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . ''
Perplexity : 818.4310033062923
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer .
Perplexity : 346.6084019871175
Sentence: he took the hint , and soon began with , `` this seems a very comfortable house .

Sentence: `` mr. collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . ''
Perplexity : 427.60833732346526

Perplexity : 722.3169650712726
Sentence: my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did .
Perplexity : 473.5204431405383

Perplexity : 1184.5122796335186
Sentence: `` it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . ''
Perplexity : 270.36387969854087
Sentence: `` an easy distance do you call it ?
Perplexity : 636.6291829677282
Sentence: it is nearly fifty miles . ''
Perplexity : 768.4602462195998
Sentence: `` and what is fifty miles of good road ?
Perplexity : 574.0652575795418
Sentence: little more than half a day 's journey .
Perplexity : 468.19236718561433
Sentence: yes , i call it a very easy distance . ''
Perplexity : 883.9174579700319
Sentence: `` i should never have said mrs. collins was settled near her family . ''
Perplexity : 283.3097624638576
Sentence: any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far . ''
Perplexity : 1140.1980483200584
Sentence: as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , '' i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .
Perplexity : 525.7759344641267
Sentence: the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .
Perplexity : 1019.1442671472313
Sentence: where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .
Perplexity : 1970.0052431398858
Sentence: mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . ''
Perplexity : 638.9479348789686
Sentence: mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , `` you can not have a right to such very strong local attachment .
Perplexity : 813.6263567183075
Sentence: you can not have been always at longbourn . ''
Perplexity : 208.98328068408745
Sentence: elizabeth looked surprised .
Perplexity : 471.1697760558795
Sentence: the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , '' are you pleased with kent ? ''

Sentence: a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .

Sentence: the tte  tte surprised them .

Sentence: `` my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . ''
Perplexity : 488.1627710138629
Sentence: but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte 's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .
Perplexity : 828.1933218123103
Sentence: within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen can not be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .
Perplexity : 1221.6182135276988

Perplexity : 2051.1797657192487
Sentence: it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam 's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .
Perplexity : 915.7882278392195
Sentence: it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .
Perplexity : 881.0384922548101
Sentence: he seldom appeared really animated .
Perplexity : 1609.033230571125
Sentence: mrs. collins knew not what to make of him .
Perplexity : 205.8537508915404
Sentence: colonel fitzwilliam 's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .
Perplexity : 823.0573595358284
Sentence: she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success .
Perplexity : 706.6498455326307
Sentence: it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .
Perplexity : 1487.3226446154977
Sentence: she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend 's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .
Perplexity : 622.7819966412285
Sentence: in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .
Perplexity : 1180.1619203723124
Sentence: he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .
Perplexity : 1155.898909140039
Sentence: more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 1172.6829060597067
Sentence: it seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .
Perplexity : 1359.7585474671782
Sentence: he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collins 's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too .
Perplexity : 683.2922372036712
Sentence: his words seemed to imply it .
Perplexity : 556.6145117356174

Perplexity : 1279.7691252043885
Sentence: `` i have been making the tour of the park , '' he replied , `` as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage .

Sentence: i speak feelingly .
Perplexity : 904.0000075092985
Sentence: a younger son , you know , must be inured to self denial and dependence . ''
Perplexity : 1791.861038133903
Sentence: now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ?
Perplexity : 2364.72600345155
Sentence: when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? ''
Perplexity : 831.1777601691482
Sentence: `` these are home questions and perhaps i can not say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature .
Perplexity : 521.0018630512852
Sentence: but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money .
Perplexity : 889.8337333595804
Sentence: younger sons can not marry where they like . ''
Perplexity : 761.6895260114578
Sentence: `` unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do . ''
Perplexity : 669.8565008820782
Sentence: `` is this , '' thought elizabeth , `` meant for me ? ''
Perplexity : 856.1986170242128
Sentence: and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , `` and pray , what is the usual price of an earl 's younger son ?
Perplexity : 1639.9659600704751
Sentence: unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . ''
Perplexity : 1381.1788745374545
Sentence: he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .
Perplexity : 703.5504869276208
Sentence: to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , '' i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .
Perplexity : 827.457402375275
Sentence: i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .
Perplexity : 1022.4654410624205
Sentence: `` no , '' said colonel fitzwilliam , `` that is an advantage which he must divide with me .
Perplexity : 812.2980193757967
Sentence: and pray what sort of guardians do you make ?
Perplexity : 682.2148457400382
Sentence: does your charge give you much trouble ?
Perplexity : 1040.6043440860383
Sentence: as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .
Perplexity : 883.6718475847456
Sentence: she directly replied , '' you need not be frightened .
Perplexity : 884.8985644574643
Sentence: i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .
Perplexity : 364.2749851970597
Sentence: she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs. hurst and miss bingley .
Perplexity : 521.2903586868464
Sentence: i think i have heard you say that you know them . ''
Perplexity : 189.28385016832598
Sentence: `` i know them a little .
Perplexity : 152.69712045498025
Sentence: their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy 's . ''
Perplexity : 335.95965886046247
Sentence: yes , '' said elizabeth drily `` mr. darcy is uncommonly kind to mr. bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . ''
Perplexity : 929.2047335897337
Sentence: `` care of him !
Perplexity : 247.95337428223178
Sentence: yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .
Perplexity : 1155.018243150248
Sentence: from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .
Perplexity : 644.7623856856832
Sentence: it was all conjecture . ''
Perplexity : 209.2386618076307
Sentence: `` it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady 's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . ''
Perplexity : 518.3843497386356
Sentence: `` you may depend upon my not mentioning it . ''
Perplexity : 332.8014354630105
Sentence: `` and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley .
Perplexity : 214.6935703867327
Sentence: what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . ''
Perplexity : 710.4908855737324
Sentence: `` did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? ''
Perplexity : 427.6004748637877
Sentence: `` i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . ''
Perplexity : 434.18592439455597
Sentence: `` and what arts did he use to separate them ? ''
Perplexity : 503.39603904353777
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .
Perplexity : 1979.843109266602
Sentence: after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .
Perplexity : 1017.9815184065814
Sentence: `` your cousin 's conduct does not suit my feelings .
Perplexity : 606.9961116002396
Sentence: why was he to be the judge ? ''
Perplexity : 211.02887137604054
Sentence: `` you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? ''
Perplexity : 767.2802177197198
Sentence: `` i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend 's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . ''
Perplexity : 631.7904860446046
Sentence: `` but , '' she continued , recollecting herself , `` as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .
Perplexity : 1209.9576292836566
Sentence: it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . ''
Perplexity : 187.97464028409226
Sentence: `` that is not an unnatural surmise , '' said fitzwilliam , `` but it is lessening the honour of my cousin 's triumph very sadly . ''
Perplexity : 971.0691493710788
Sentence: this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr. darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .
Perplexity : 1416.8002938365355
Sentence: there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .
Perplexity : 1088.7284264588948
Sentence: it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .
Perplexity : 336.3641110657118
Sentence: that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr. bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .
Perplexity : 513.8562891019066
Sentence: if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .
Perplexity : 1427.1662511361258
Sentence: `` to jane herself , '' she exclaimed , `` there could be no possibility of objection .
Perplexity : 781.1394842169634
Sentence: her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .
Perplexity : 2570.8657961828076
Sentence: neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . ''
Perplexity : 1983.8861109663335
Sentence: when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr. darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend 's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister .
Perplexity : 1089.8231478988023
Sentence: the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .
Perplexity : 1069.9726454773954
Sentence: mrs. collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr. collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine 's being rather displeased by her staying at home .
Perplexity : 1030.4209914609157
Sentence: they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .
Perplexity : 3563.395494097267
Sentence: but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .
Perplexity : 1374.4168222001133
Sentence: elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .
Perplexity : 1102.7509481236284
Sentence: mr. darcy 's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister 's sufferings .
Perplexity : 939.3831750391669
Sentence: it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .
Perplexity : 605.1272338852156
Sentence: while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .
Perplexity : 1146.918533776773
Sentence: but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr. darcy walk into the room .
Perplexity : 1530.2744315792056
Sentence: in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .
Perplexity : 830.0237045586457
Sentence: she answered him with cold civility .
Perplexity : 492.15289816698464
Sentence: he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .
Perplexity : 1000.593181343349
Sentence: it will not do .
Perplexity : 128.89508974240232
Sentence: my feelings will not be repressed .
Perplexity : 422.58071104024305
Sentence: you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you . ''
Perplexity : 376.5892082082724
Sentence: elizabeth 's astonishment was beyond expression .
Perplexity : 563.9721271447388
Sentence: she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .
Perplexity : 6704.245502499108
Sentence: this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .
Perplexity : 888.8064968433389
Sentence: he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .
Perplexity : 738.6743636902828
Sentence: in spite of her deeply rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man 's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .
Perplexity : 1109.90195314838
Sentence: she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .
Perplexity : 1652.4250125308067
Sentence: he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .
Perplexity : 650.025481310108
Sentence: as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .
Perplexity : 480.3876663887845
Sentence: he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .
Perplexity : 1449.2866671453835
Sentence: such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , '' in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .
Perplexity : 2098.7115561687583
Sentence: it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you .
Perplexity : 886.118033983766
Sentence: but i can not i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .
Perplexity : 652.5554612783138
Sentence: i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .
Perplexity : 378.6440861782189
Sentence: the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . ''
Perplexity : 1320.0041173956884
Sentence: mr. darcy , who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .
Perplexity : 1427.599170404895
Sentence: the pause was to elizabeth 's feelings dreadful .
Perplexity : 303.80990498765874
Sentence: at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , '' and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !
Perplexity : 780.281732981049
Sentence: i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected .
Perplexity : 2488.7326505011843
Sentence: but it is of small importance . ''
Perplexity : 219.81208198468227
Sentence: `` i might as well enquire , '' replied she , `` why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?
Perplexity : 1319.645498485575
Sentence: was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil ?
Perplexity : 1122.4911002208107
Sentence: but i have other provocations .
Perplexity : 412.0586494620154
Sentence: you know i have .
Perplexity : 116.88219507472381
Sentence: had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? ''
Perplexity : 1286.5896362039975
Sentence: as she pronounced these words , mr. darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .
Perplexity : 1160.8773128003
Sentence: `` i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .
Perplexity : 183.1275172636558
Sentence: no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .
Perplexity : 1060.176640697971
Sentence: you dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . ''
Perplexity : 1051.4580468272704
Sentence: he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .
Perplexity : 453.1587636820514
Sentence: `` can you deny that you have done it ? ''
Perplexity : 264.27303936160456
Sentence: she repeated .
Perplexity : 242.83544718982665
Sentence: with assumed tranquillity he then replied , `` i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success .
Perplexity : 780.7341582456368
Sentence: towards him i have been kinder than towards myself . ''
Perplexity : 476.2053537297883
Sentence: long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .
Perplexity : 717.3819503677531
Sentence: your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 637.875829163448
Sentence: on this subject , what can you have to say ?
Perplexity : 606.569853348507
Sentence: or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? ''
Perplexity : 2475.806974893686
Sentence: `` who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? ''
Perplexity : 822.6347540457566
Sentence: `` his misfortunes ! ''
Perplexity : 364.7791933814551
Sentence: repeated darcy contemptuously ; `` yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . ''
Perplexity : 1076.203277538636
Sentence: `` and of your infliction , '' cried elizabeth with energy .
Perplexity : 739.3078207092942
Sentence: `` you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .
Perplexity : 1461.5969567125765
Sentence: you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .
Perplexity : 591.3686667046373
Sentence: you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .
Perplexity : 798.0374154833851
Sentence: you have done all this !
Perplexity : 296.60812367753084
Sentence: and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . ''
Perplexity : 512.8615161480118
Sentence: `` and this , '' cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , '' is your opinion of me !
Perplexity : 1083.5098095436047
Sentence: this is the estimation in which you hold me !
Perplexity : 450.28910663594087
Sentence: i thank you for explaining it so fully .
Perplexity : 574.4710754581197
Sentence: my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !
Perplexity : 6177.407436599244
Sentence: but perhaps , '' added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , `` these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .
Perplexity : 1873.6090651729212
Sentence: but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .
Perplexity : 639.613214485936
Sentence: nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .
Perplexity : 343.4111453769932
Sentence: they were natural and just .
Perplexity : 305.6589600808947
Sentence: could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?
Perplexity : 501.7643441383383
Sentence: to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? ''
Perplexity : 1196.518938754099
Sentence: elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , '' you are mistaken , mr. darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ''
Perplexity : 852.4474924157092
Sentence: she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , '' you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ''
Perplexity : 600.5758493127413
Sentence: she went on .
Perplexity : 176.58082975916946
Sentence: `` you have said quite enough , madam .
Perplexity : 901.4703367155115
Sentence: i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .
Perplexity : 465.1581946295444
Sentence: forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . ''

Sentence: so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend 's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !

Perplexity : 884.3660422690498

Sentence: i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .

Sentence: wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .
Perplexity : 1489.8173216890586
Sentence: if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your 's , i can only say that i am sorry .

Sentence: your sister i also watched .
Perplexity : 594.2647701802326

Perplexity : 1508.6864859616162
Sentence: if you have not been mistaken here , i must have been in an error .
Perplexity : 567.7917607832502

Perplexity : 4082.9828492182

Sentence: but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .
Perplexity : 1098.2852296479023
Sentence: i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .

Sentence: i can not blame myself for having done thus much .
Perplexity : 520.5168831154249

Sentence: i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .
Perplexity : 597.1452213252828
Sentence: that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .
Perplexity : 686.570928393962
Sentence: perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .
Perplexity : 4562.2249094184035

Sentence: mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .
Perplexity : 1071.2471172230044
Sentence: my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education .
Perplexity : 1514.8164515943004
Sentence: my father was not only fond of this young man 's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .
Perplexity : 876.2065840124719
Sentence: as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner .
Perplexity : 667.8836015100916
Sentence: the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr. darcy could not have .
Perplexity : 862.98903840231
Sentence: here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell .
Perplexity : 454.61004627325985

Sentence: it adds even another motive .
Perplexity : 1291.5324774806732
Sentence: my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .
Perplexity : 885.4194941099897
Sentence: there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .
Perplexity : 692.6985459708901
Sentence: his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr. wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .

Perplexity : 989.8151964140665
Sentence: in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .
Perplexity : 1522.678695606186
Sentence: for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .
Perplexity : 452.86885611441767
Sentence: his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .
Perplexity : 1645.768914556709
Sentence: he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions .
Perplexity : 850.1174959638439
Sentence: you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .
Perplexity : 1290.710200142994
Sentence: his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .
Perplexity : 516.6871879656331
Sentence: after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .
Perplexity : 1470.0143974014952
Sentence: but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .

Sentence: about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .
Perplexity : 1204.2643219050863
Sentence: she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .
Perplexity : 774.5179398710382
Sentence: i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .
Perplexity : 1058.10806213652
Sentence: you may imagine what i felt and how i acted .
Perplexity : 365.18126430161607
Sentence: regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge .
Perplexity : 1199.334741762394
Sentence: his revenge would have been complete indeed .
Perplexity : 757.55647308712
Sentence: this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 1724.8749208092875
Sentence: i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .
Perplexity : 552.1289722085224
Sentence: ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .
Perplexity : 1137.8511605817705
Sentence: you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .
Perplexity : 566.1131555208906
Sentence: but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .
Perplexity : 323.55225828392264
Sentence: for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .
Perplexity : 1255.2789907669148
Sentence: i will only add , god bless you .
Perplexity : 2162.294927932322
Sentence: `` fitzwilliam darcy . ''
Perplexity : 189.33349088218768
Sentence: if elizabeth , when mr. darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .
Perplexity : 891.0562503952985
Sentence: but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .
Perplexity : 982.4561251081986
Sentence: her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .
Perplexity : 374.95611609428636

Sentence: with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield .
Perplexity : 753.0251480447834
Sentence: she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .
Perplexity : 986.0880287302163
Sentence: his belief of her sister 's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .
Perplexity : 1016.6974998397448
Sentence: he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .
Perplexity : 745.8219714265264
Sentence: it was all pride and insolence .
Perplexity : 369.4871251318111
Sentence: astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .
Perplexity : 9023.068001841437
Sentence: she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , `` this must be false !
Perplexity : 2661.723472305238
Sentence: this must be the grossest falsehood ! ''
Perplexity : 695.6832691707444
Sentence: and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .
Perplexity : 991.2626102850053
Sentence: in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .
Perplexity : 884.2916082793797
Sentence: the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .
Perplexity : 750.8275385164229
Sentence: so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .
Perplexity : 737.4185888657161
Sentence: what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .
Perplexity : 812.2217642710812
Sentence: but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham 's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .
Perplexity : 1775.434944612375
Sentence: she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success .
Perplexity : 1157.7100357997406
Sentence: on both sides it was only assertion .
Perplexity : 774.4554636701399
Sentence: again she read on .
Perplexity : 263.50517713433374
Sentence: the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr. wickham 's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .
Perplexity : 1037.8188417911435
Sentence: of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself .
Perplexity : 565.9141792404109
Sentence: as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .
Perplexity : 744.9429546350594
Sentence: his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .
Perplexity : 1691.9120617421388
Sentence: she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .
Perplexity : 2207.239655867089
Sentence: but no such recollection befriended her .
Perplexity : 661.6957849181915
Sentence: she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .
Perplexity : 780.3058833082722
Sentence: after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .
Perplexity : 1246.9206416406341
Sentence: but , alas !
Perplexity : 8095.739389684895
Sentence: the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin 's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .
Perplexity : 675.4191422059921
Sentence: at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin 's corroboration .
Perplexity : 803.2334996092727
Sentence: she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr. philips 's .

Sentence: many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .
Perplexity : 544.8802938914469
Sentence: she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .
Perplexity : 677.1908815268285
Sentence: she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .
Perplexity : 719.2612930717967
Sentence: she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr. darcy that mr. darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week .
Perplexity : 609.7689335386708
Sentence: she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr. darcy 's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .
Perplexity : 1007.1847716558254
Sentence: how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !
Perplexity : 692.1245533669755
Sentence: his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .
Perplexity : 886.6775875316232

Perplexity : 321.85051302057724

Sentence: the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .

Sentence: i am not equal to it .
Perplexity : 145.77437503736297
Sentence: wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .
Perplexity : 615.5276176851769
Sentence: at present i will say nothing about it . ''
Perplexity : 263.79375507957934
Sentence: to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .
Perplexity : 640.5518048801415
Sentence: the tumult of elizabeth 's mind was allayed by this conversation .
Perplexity : 537.8674383424632
Sentence: but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .
Perplexity : 2323.750216052458
Sentence: she dared not relate the other half of mr. darcy 's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .

Sentence: `` and then , '' said she , `` if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .

Sentence: she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .
Perplexity : 728.9824653416475
Sentence: having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .
Perplexity : 1304.7557908836043
Sentence: `` well , lizzy , '' said mrs. bennet one day , `` what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane 's ?

Sentence: though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .
Perplexity : 402.8576438619277
Sentence: but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .
Perplexity : 671.5925516811327
Sentence: `` well , lizzy , '' continued her mother soon afterwards , `` and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ?
Perplexity : 1946.015778858059
Sentence: well , well , i only hope it will last .

Perplexity : 450.0039267261103
Sentence: well , much good may it do them !
Perplexity : 980.6638412089235
Sentence: and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead .
Perplexity : 1156.9417761439852
Sentence: they look upon it quite as their own , i dare say , whenever that happens . ''
Perplexity : 1285.7160502248298
Sentence: `` no .
Perplexity : 90.17809074103425
Sentence: it would have been strange if they had .

Sentence: i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . ''

Sentence: the first week of their return was soon gone .
Perplexity : 342.8354231251103
Sentence: it was the last of the regiment 's stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .
Perplexity : 559.9723910892479
Sentence: the dejection was almost universal .
Perplexity : 865.0514285303556
Sentence: the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .
Perplexity : 2663.4086436596303
Sentence: very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family .
Perplexity : 1135.4492605681762
Sentence: `` good heaven !
Perplexity : 742.3299877649287

Sentence: would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .
Perplexity : 880.6766289043173
Sentence: `` how can you be smiling so , lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 803.3496785951394
Sentence: their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .
Perplexity : 1521.8491908793974
Sentence: i thought i should have broke my heart . ''
Perplexity : 368.2157186100981
Sentence: `` i am sure i shall break mine , '' said lydia .
Perplexity : 866.7447111853796
Sentence: `` if one could but go to brighton ! ''

Sentence: if one could but go to brighton !

Sentence: but papa is so disagreeable . ''

Sentence: `` a little sea bathing would set me up for ever . ''
Perplexity : 697.3449174203555
Sentence: `` and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , '' added kitty .
Perplexity : 501.4103449506578
Sentence: such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house .
Perplexity : 1293.8668393124185
Sentence: elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .
Perplexity : 435.0262764444683
Sentence: she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy 's objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .
Perplexity : 409.7275156167676
Sentence: but the gloom of lydia 's prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs. forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton .
Perplexity : 724.6344289059633
Sentence: a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two .
Perplexity : 669.8573803336621
Sentence: the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs. forster , the delight of mrs. bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described .
Perplexity : 1235.348316972197
Sentence: wholly inattentive to her sister 's feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one 's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .
Perplexity : 1692.126808281031
Sentence: `` i can not see why mrs. forster should not ask me as well as lydia , '' said she , `` though i am not her particular friend .
Perplexity : 532.003774013589
Sentence: as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .
Perplexity : 643.8541884330817
Sentence: she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia 's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .
Perplexity : 779.1612325187078
Sentence: he heard her attentively , and then said , '' lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ''
Perplexity : 788.1196931234974
Sentence: `` if you were aware , '' said elizabeth , `` of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia 's unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair . ''
Perplexity : 1069.7379318743706
Sentence: `` already arisen ! ''
Perplexity : 851.9107001165619
Sentence: repeated mr. bennet .

Sentence: how much of good or evil must be done by him !
Perplexity : 430.7763049755571
Sentence: every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .
Perplexity : 1122.1342387045254
Sentence: as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .

Sentence: they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .
Perplexity : 1413.8489489098067
Sentence: amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .
Perplexity : 889.1456617179517
Sentence: nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .
Perplexity : 938.5288447992898
Sentence: the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .

Sentence: she was overpowered by shame and vexation .
Perplexity : 594.0802784140798
Sentence: her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world !

Perplexity : 477.74460630476284
Sentence: in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !
Perplexity : 629.5944065041311
Sentence: it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !
Perplexity : 593.4405338708976
Sentence: why did she come ?
Perplexity : 574.3897170590423
Sentence: or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?
Perplexity : 928.7362908573216
Sentence: had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .
Perplexity : 1113.6441793165923
Sentence: she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .
Perplexity : 423.57396622376325
Sentence: and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ?
Perplexity : 2524.5774746277957
Sentence: but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !
Perplexity : 761.8568349907407
Sentence: what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing 's park , when he put his letter into her hand !
Perplexity : 1003.923122953985
Sentence: she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .
Perplexity : 442.03382378143937
Sentence: they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .
Perplexity : 805.0358392977975
Sentence: her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr. darcy then was .
Perplexity : 975.792305331945
Sentence: she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .
Perplexity : 564.018645399216
Sentence: perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .
Perplexity : 766.4815866983072
Sentence: whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .
Perplexity : 533.1899902849223
Sentence: at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .
Perplexity : 1107.5567785693106
Sentence: they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .
Perplexity : 2229.556739547957
Sentence: mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .
Perplexity : 857.5503102868108
Sentence: with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .
Perplexity : 1680.808270574428
Sentence: it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .
Perplexity : 1848.470619064766
Sentence: they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it .
Perplexity : 1742.7575200582498
Sentence: elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .
Perplexity : 1384.2681789598087
Sentence: her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .
Perplexity : 1515.459437648034
Sentence: the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .
Perplexity : 851.5167949272503
Sentence: elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .
Perplexity : 1451.5492984468128
Sentence: for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .
Perplexity : 1644.3900879980902
Sentence: this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .
Perplexity : 897.6753576465075
Sentence: with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words `` delightful , '' and `` charming , '' when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .
Perplexity : 1386.6049299664055
Sentence: mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .
Perplexity : 608.6337197561634
Sentence: `` what will be his surprise , '' thought she , `` when he knows who they are !
Perplexity : 775.1806413538259
Sentence: he takes them now for people of fashion . ''
Perplexity : 482.21764801181126
Sentence: the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .
Perplexity : 956.8413458246337
Sentence: that he was surprised by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr. gardiner .
Perplexity : 1125.209503350038
Sentence: elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .
Perplexity : 552.8233613290063
Sentence: she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .
Perplexity : 2012.4920780962461
Sentence: the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .
Perplexity : 1721.6318096755945
Sentence: mrs. gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .
Perplexity : 1382.9211124903866
Sentence: from what can it proceed ?
Perplexity : 591.3461818819128
Sentence: it can not be for me , it can not be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .
Perplexity : 464.62236229113313
Sentence: my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .
Perplexity : 560.236181042399
Sentence: it is impossible that he should still love me . ''
Perplexity : 269.4536347970976
Sentence: after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .
Perplexity : 2189.1555594048473
Sentence: it originated in mrs. gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth 's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband 's .
Perplexity : 2105.453661027022
Sentence: mr. darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .
Perplexity : 634.0650060864266
Sentence: after a short silence , the lady first spoke .
Perplexity : 1094.5824549601377
Sentence: she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected `` for your housekeeper , '' she added , `` informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . ''
Perplexity : 793.6472771878709
Sentence: he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .
Perplexity : 406.87115994880753
Sentence: elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .
Perplexity : 639.4953480096774
Sentence: `` there is also one other person in the party , '' he continued after a pause , `` who more particularly wishes to be known to you , will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? ''
Perplexity : 954.4781259892694
Sentence: the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .
Perplexity : 279.7443934305075
Sentence: she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .
Perplexity : 595.9891530327537
Sentence: they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought .
Perplexity : 425.56130762882214
Sentence: elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .
Perplexity : 255.8264207074348

Sentence: `` to be sure , lizzy , '' said her aunt , `` he is not so handsome as wickham ; or rather he has not wickham 's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .
Perplexity : 807.4532705914561
Sentence: but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? ''
Perplexity : 308.2358726778005
Sentence: `` but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , '' replied her uncle .
Perplexity : 621.9718232333358
Sentence: elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .
Perplexity : 736.9975668513987
Sentence: `` from what we have seen of him , '' continued mrs. gardiner , `` i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham .
Perplexity : 653.2517812295087
Sentence: on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .
Perplexity : 1353.1109053430719
Sentence: and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .

Perplexity : 1492.766552768498

Sentence: no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .
Perplexity : 982.1792480377372
Sentence: the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .

Perplexity : 2310.266282610116
Sentence: such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .
Perplexity : 997.8610508123464
Sentence: it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy 's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .

Perplexity : 601.5871387264399
Sentence: georgiana 's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .
Perplexity : 1170.3098229280151
Sentence: mrs. gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .
Perplexity : 1894.3891270506117
Sentence: by mrs. hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .
Perplexity : 1484.623760956002
Sentence: it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .
Perplexity : 1562.4909065303546
Sentence: miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .
Perplexity : 695.3988603488434
Sentence: this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .
Perplexity : 552.6047675811501
Sentence: her own thoughts were employing her .
Perplexity : 571.069419632545
Sentence: she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .
Perplexity : 341.4118940261994

Perplexity : 759.4486137516294
Sentence: she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .
Perplexity : 781.8752437657945
Sentence: the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .
Perplexity : 1180.6064265089647
Sentence: there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .
Perplexity : 1664.4831259460661
Sentence: while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .
Perplexity : 866.7240788732188
Sentence: he had been some time with mr. gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .
Perplexity : 798.3149380876154
Sentence: no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .
Perplexity : 865.0099588126043
Sentence: in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley 's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over .
Perplexity : 769.8627251324758
Sentence: miss darcy , on her brother 's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .
Perplexity : 1080.4487215068152
Sentence: miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , '' pray , miss eliza , are not the shire militia removed from meryton ?
Perplexity : 2344.2081409221446
Sentence: they must be a great loss to your family . ''
Perplexity : 250.1119902601535
Sentence: in darcy 's presence she dared not mention wickham 's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment 's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .
Perplexity : 1215.2739489070216
Sentence: had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy 's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .
Perplexity : 928.1588507111938
Sentence: not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy 's meditated elopement .
Perplexity : 580.371366701585
Sentence: to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley 's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .
Perplexity : 993.006271688334
Sentence: he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .
Perplexity : 767.3611628556393
Sentence: elizabeth 's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .
Perplexity : 2186.212577866412
Sentence: her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .
Perplexity : 1239.5225581309671
Sentence: their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress .
Perplexity : 1115.9495145777412
Sentence: but georgiana would not join her .
Perplexity : 337.9472467408045
Sentence: `` how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy , '' she cried ; `` i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .
Perplexity : 656.9133175658075
Sentence: louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again . ''
Perplexity : 350.92024064440653
Sentence: however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .
Perplexity : 1872.9240593562647
Sentence: her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .
Perplexity : 551.5007866873184
Sentence: her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines .
Perplexity : 982.1564600199476
Sentence: her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .
Perplexity : 892.1941278834428
Sentence: they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . ''
Perplexity : 1632.9936003079617
Sentence: persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .
Perplexity : 783.4422051885011
Sentence: he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , '' i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , 'she a beauty !
Perplexity : 1403.6072231274568
Sentence: i should as soon call her mother a wit . '
Perplexity : 481.94188313160276
Sentence: but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . ''
Perplexity : 515.4175041161133
Sentence: `` yes , '' replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , `` but that was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . ''
Perplexity : 756.1299844209994
Sentence: he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .
Perplexity : 479.2138372914313
Sentence: mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .
Perplexity : 1398.6928733889247

Perplexity : 870.9074914897207

Sentence: but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .
Perplexity : 1520.0498276534088
Sentence: be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia 's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .

Sentence: but now it was all too natural .
Perplexity : 261.87906795127736
Sentence: for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .

Perplexity : 566.8422469730725
Sentence: she was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle 's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .
Perplexity : 1152.5245139635485
Sentence: mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant 's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .

Sentence: `` and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth !
Perplexity : 438.8350609220426
Sentence: but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .
Perplexity : 547.8505948515493
Sentence: had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .
Perplexity : 755.4851216464707
Sentence: `` i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , '' said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; `` and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .

Sentence: `` not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .
Perplexity : 441.04397995260615

Perplexity : 407.4516468935077
Sentence: but i dare not hope it .
Perplexity : 197.65448846188085
Sentence: why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ? ''
Perplexity : 556.706387631495
Sentence: `` in the first place , '' replied mr. gardiner , `` there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland . ''
Perplexity : 704.2724216421625
Sentence: but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !
Perplexity : 1137.9503719905892
Sentence: and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road . ''

Sentence: `` well , then supposing them to be in london .
Perplexity : 608.6078249481427
Sentence: they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .
Perplexity : 1423.79797317529

Sentence: why any fear of detection ?

Sentence: as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .
Perplexity : 619.1906303828073
Sentence: but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good .
Perplexity : 741.8163180851376
Sentence: lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father 's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . ''

Perplexity : 405.1649364676667
Sentence: she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .

Perplexity : 822.4665376465994

Perplexity : 1447.4912338814352
Sentence: if you 'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight .
Perplexity : 1176.9577908687004
Sentence: not one party , or scheme , or any thing .
Perplexity : 2106.7634465950746

Sentence: you may depend upon my seeking no further . ''

Sentence: on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .
Perplexity : 956.0408810675167
Sentence: but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .
Perplexity : 373.9874281110198
Sentence: it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .
Perplexity : 1449.9857714655127
Sentence: those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .
Perplexity : 2281.333612162022
Sentence: she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .
Perplexity : 1154.3362103262568
Sentence: `` you may readily comprehend , '' she added , `` what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .
Perplexity : 1003.098339174257
Sentence: pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . ''
Perplexity : 1041.9641233407035
Sentence: `` not that i shall though , '' she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; `` and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . ''
Perplexity : 682.1428336052599
Sentence: jane 's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .
Perplexity : 614.9216117884206
Sentence: she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .

Sentence: `` gracechurch street , sept. 6 .
Perplexity : 9433.041313516685

Sentence: from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .
Perplexity : 1073.1087475322345
Sentence: the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .
Perplexity : 890.1111206548187
Sentence: he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .
Perplexity : 1196.103736518893
Sentence: his character was to speak for itself .
Perplexity : 299.8739024613079

Perplexity : 729.6334682365779
Sentence: he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .

Sentence: there is a lady , it seems , a mrs. younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .

Sentence: but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .
Perplexity : 367.88024471973233

Sentence: she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .
Perplexity : 536.1720333585571
Sentence: since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .
Perplexity : 2033.108513187994
Sentence: he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia 's flight , on her own folly alone .

Perplexity : 939.1232850405559

Perplexity : 464.4128479377039

Perplexity : 815.6759184286193
Sentence: but mr. gardiner could not be seen , and mr. darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .
Perplexity : 1233.6201737146373
Sentence: he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .

Sentence: but our visitor was very obstinate .
Perplexity : 765.6833676909079
Sentence: i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .
Perplexity : 1515.9318178286815
Sentence: he has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one .
Perplexity : 563.9921542516605
Sentence: nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .
Perplexity : 561.554069112153
Sentence: they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .
Perplexity : 738.4659397716807
Sentence: but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .
Perplexity : 1046.107480277036
Sentence: but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .
Perplexity : 2018.7240402427017
Sentence: you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people .

Perplexity : 2234.082788559767
Sentence: the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .
Perplexity : 442.67050213154846
Sentence: it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .
Perplexity : 910.2206596665278
Sentence: perhaps there was some truth in this ; though i doubt whether his reserve , or anybody 's reserve , can be answerable for the event .
Perplexity : 1211.284821324757
Sentence: but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .

Perplexity : 743.7069604684932
Sentence: i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .

Perplexity : 965.3249232189938
Sentence: the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sister 's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !
Perplexity : 1204.2000585864744
Sentence: he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .
Perplexity : 1486.7266073078972

Sentence: it was a rational scheme to be sure !
Perplexity : 356.19669754170695
Sentence: but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .
Perplexity : 857.458660395987

Sentence: she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .

Perplexity : 1114.9060493994093
Sentence: the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs. bennet 's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .

Perplexity : 1156.2341898591258

Perplexity : 640.3226525058724
Sentence: her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr. darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .

Sentence: instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine 's visit .

Perplexity : 1393.3586551674678
Sentence: the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .
Perplexity : 542.7371390814559
Sentence: had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .

Sentence: do not repeat what i then said .

Perplexity : 441.3420981028647

Perplexity : 582.6598113395598
Sentence: elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .
Perplexity : 794.5045864690748
Sentence: as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , `` mr. bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day ? ''
Perplexity : 1179.1803340269123

Perplexity : 610.2128200561889

Perplexity : 293.45656579970387
Sentence: she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .
Perplexity : 544.7681458392982
Sentence: but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .
Perplexity : 775.8509470066298
Sentence: in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
Perplexity : 1078.303665782838
Sentence: she did not fear her father 's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .
Perplexity : 1405.1460532568478
Sentence: in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , `` go to your father , he wants you in the library . ''

Perplexity : 932.2265599003229
Sentence: have not you always hated him ? ''
Perplexity : 380.38434506049043
Sentence: how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
Perplexity : 1345.2711442980435
Sentence: it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 617.9661372651775
Sentence: `` or in other words , you are determined to have him .
Perplexity : 491.22410454581393

Sentence: `` lizzy , '' said her father , `` i have given him my consent .
Perplexity : 777.3616321336062
Sentence: he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .
Perplexity : 1148.0670361578718
Sentence: i now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .
Perplexity : 431.78355293397436
Sentence: but let me advise you to think better of it .
Perplexity : 277.46777373666123

Perplexity : 800.3829232576131
Sentence: your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .
Perplexity : 801.0433546293121

Sentence: my child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .
Perplexity : 821.4353040715744
Sentence: you know not what you are about . ''
Perplexity : 179.7707813917732
Sentence: elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
Perplexity : 1450.4265293536387
Sentence: `` well , my dear , '' said he , when she ceased speaking , `` i have no more to say .
Perplexity : 1210.5265177424424
Sentence: i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy . ''
Perplexity : 819.0817316360728

Sentence: it will save me a world of trouble and economy .
Perplexity : 524.9786082985034

Perplexity : 772.4809147195499
Sentence: i shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . ''
Perplexity : 514.9882991840815
Sentence: he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr. collins 's letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , `` if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure . ''
Perplexity : 1077.55746174458
Sentence: elizabeth 's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour 's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .
