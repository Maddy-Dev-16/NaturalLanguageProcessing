Sentence: miss bennet 's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest .
Perplexity : 397.6956991825808
Sentence: by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother 's admiration .
Perplexity : 412.0285556835091
Sentence: it was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .
Perplexity : 363.70868868068044
Sentence: she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas .
Perplexity : 306.5137869710877
Sentence: `` it may perhaps be pleasant , '' replied charlotte , `` to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .
Perplexity : 324.7648216069923
Sentence: if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .
Perplexity : 450.35113170008674
Sentence: we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .
Perplexity : 683.9660076163112
Sentence: in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .
Perplexity : 790.5758690743395
Sentence: bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . ''
Perplexity : 377.3272706827673
Sentence: `` but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .
Perplexity : 279.2106304993087
Sentence: if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . ''
Perplexity : 320.8626562818978
Sentence: `` but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . ''
Perplexity : 254.42313607652773
Sentence: `` perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .
Perplexity : 239.46814066192172
Sentence: but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .
Perplexity : 588.626543062651
Sentence: jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .
Perplexity : 447.9221060640969
Sentence: when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . ''
Perplexity : 348.77590667804947
Sentence: `` your plan is a good one , '' replied elizabeth , `` where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it .
Perplexity : 335.26228965875646
Sentence: but these are not jane 's feelings ; she is not acting by design .
Perplexity : 401.33425204797066
Sentence: she has known him only a fortnight .
Perplexity : 374.5042294280863
Sentence: she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .
Perplexity : 553.7814395706961
Sentence: this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . ''
Perplexity : 293.947402550213
Sentence: had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . ''
Perplexity : 636.7299894034086
Sentence: `` well , '' said charlotte , `` i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .
Perplexity : 254.2881683323636
Sentence: happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .
Perplexity : 537.1164208041201
Sentence: they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . ''
Perplexity : 493.28652331643843
Sentence: you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . ''
Perplexity : 276.40738553274105
Sentence: occupied in observing mr. bingley 's attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .
Perplexity : 425.22765630910504
Sentence: mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .
Perplexity : 346.22623432900923
Sentence: but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .
Perplexity : 513.461913134209
Sentence: though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .
Perplexity : 595.5446942560807
Sentence: he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .
Perplexity : 268.32972253485525
Sentence: his doing so drew her notice .
Perplexity : 557.256780645095
Sentence: it was at sir william lucas 's , where a large party were assembled .
Perplexity : 500.9841728281238
Sentence: `` what does mr. darcy mean , '' said she to charlotte , `` by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? ''
Perplexity : 302.90791022962213
Sentence: `` that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer . ''
Perplexity : 268.95007797357516
Sentence: `` but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about .
Perplexity : 299.7855479855118
Sentence: on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , '' did not you think , mr. darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? ''
Perplexity : 371.7731036832031
Sentence: `` with great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . ''
Perplexity : 471.01254801514165
Sentence: `` you are severe on us . ''
Perplexity : 296.91165093794945
Sentence: `` it will be her turn soon to be teazed , '' said miss lucas .
Perplexity : 262.66050178384563
Sentence: always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !
Perplexity : 822.9967710044432
Sentence: if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . ''
Perplexity : 464.44353748146517
Sentence: on miss lucas 's persevering , however , she added , `` very well ; if it must be so , it must . ''
Perplexity : 212.46309694290653
Sentence: and gravely glancing at mr. darcy , `` there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and i shall keep mine to swell my song . ''
Perplexity : 801.8475358146399
Sentence: her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .
Perplexity : 558.3605340010492
Sentence: after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .
Perplexity : 447.31229053817634
Sentence: mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .
Perplexity : 794.2579528402464
Sentence: elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .
Perplexity : 461.6502318919743
Sentence: mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began .
Perplexity : 578.6117868491108
Sentence: `` what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 409.27524607831515

Perplexity : 523.4236977952395
Sentence: `` i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas . ''
Perplexity : 514.6731554006025
Sentence: he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , '' my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing ?
Perplexity : 397.3465158656167
Sentence: mr. darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner .
Perplexity : 325.7830829841461

Perplexity : 800.3363127886914

Sentence: `` i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , '' said he , `` that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .

Sentence: the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .
Perplexity : 471.9651703967956

Perplexity : 311.35575805335947
Sentence: if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once .

Perplexity : 421.1299769725528
Sentence: but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcy 's pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr. denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , '' i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . ''
Perplexity : 457.57160873089543
Sentence: this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .
Perplexity : 563.8327902310355
Sentence: she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .
Perplexity : 500.52805157646355
Sentence: but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .
Perplexity : 369.28210643607923
Sentence: the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .
Perplexity : 441.5325788942825
Sentence: mr. collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .
Perplexity : 592.9816935985908
Sentence: the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .
Perplexity : 406.7984383061679

Perplexity : 328.96486020356167
Sentence: he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her .

Sentence: `` i dare say you will find him very agreeable . ''
Perplexity : 327.1467152574855

Sentence: do not wish me such an evil . ''
Perplexity : 357.145758617235
Sentence: when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .
Perplexity : 453.7532900006643
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .
Perplexity : 487.3721505618677
Sentence: they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .
Perplexity : 470.5925404373115
Sentence: he replied , and was again silent .
Perplexity : 189.25649449938388
Sentence: i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . ''
Perplexity : 341.0536185172465
Sentence: `` very well .
Perplexity : 161.30654978548694

Sentence: `` do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? ''
Perplexity : 517.596524579704
Sentence: one must speak a little , you know .
Perplexity : 227.17009168044478
Sentence: it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . ''
Perplexity : 401.99577102627677
Sentence: `` are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? ''
Perplexity : 514.1268964342021
Sentence: `` both , '' replied elizabeth archly ; `` for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .
Perplexity : 431.7006394002333
Sentence: we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . ''

Sentence: she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , `` when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . ''

Sentence: the effect was immediate .
Perplexity : 376.1518014427648
Sentence: a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .
Perplexity : 427.36785136909555
Sentence: at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , '' mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . ''
Perplexity : 563.1366058241815
Sentence: darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .

Perplexity : 760.9161757905528

Perplexity : 552.9635545423246
Sentence: recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , '' sir william 's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . ''
Perplexity : 361.35374609332825

Perplexity : 1340.3410105496448

Sentence: `` the present always occupies you in such scenes does it ? ''
Perplexity : 558.6125284405624
Sentence: said he , with a look of doubt .
Perplexity : 173.29841956207972
Sentence: `` yes , always , '' she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , `` i remember hearing you once say , mr. darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .
Perplexity : 429.82113319331387
Sentence: you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its being created . ''
Perplexity : 299.20488591921094

Sentence: `` merely to the illustration of your character , '' said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .

Sentence: `` i am trying to make it out . ''
Perplexity : 246.7525543853118

Sentence: `` i do not get on at all .

Sentence: i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . ''
Perplexity : 614.3787213522089
Sentence: `` i can readily believe , '' answered he gravely , `` that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . ''
Perplexity : 378.1716100874148
Sentence: `` i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , '' he coldly replied .
Perplexity : 484.57661076193534
Sentence: she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy 's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .
Perplexity : 500.2202980914677
Sentence: they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , '' so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !
Perplexity : 507.8924671954521
Sentence: your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr. darcy 's steward .
Perplexity : 365.78404280689097
Sentence: let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr. darcy 's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner .
Perplexity : 394.22593575402914
Sentence: i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame , that he can not bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .
Perplexity : 307.3378708446363
Sentence: his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .
Perplexity : 325.58199704253803
Sentence: i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ''
Perplexity : 476.0213647386407
Sentence: `` his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , '' said elizabeth angrily ; `` for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcy 's steward , and of that , i can assure you , he informed me himself . ''
Perplexity : 306.8898177823039
Sentence: `` i beg your pardon , '' replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .
Perplexity : 431.5994540874094
Sentence: `` excuse my interference .
Perplexity : 605.6183656129159
Sentence: `` insolent girl ! ''
Perplexity : 787.1871976586257
Sentence: i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr .
Perplexity : 502.6714796315396
Sentence: she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley .
Perplexity : 511.90357351172156
Sentence: jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .
Perplexity : 512.3124005368027
Sentence: elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane 's being in the fairest way for happiness .
Perplexity : 471.9109158431331
Sentence: `` i want to know , '' said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister 's , `` what you have learnt about mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 251.8729417851215
Sentence: but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ''
Perplexity : 448.7398231400989
Sentence: mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister 's , mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
Perplexity : 385.1190119343864
Sentence: i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr. darcy 's regard . ''
Perplexity : 404.85489795533385
Sentence: `` no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton . ''
Perplexity : 295.50433626630695
Sentence: `` this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 346.98126004909386
Sentence: i am perfectly satisfied .
Perplexity : 437.46144335988276

Perplexity : 618.2852688230976
Sentence: his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .
Perplexity : 342.6036635901752
Sentence: it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane 's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .
Perplexity : 394.05618705917436

Perplexity : 398.94113426759924
Sentence: by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .
Perplexity : 517.7145480262043
Sentence: elizabeth 's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .
Perplexity : 573.4865174396652

Perplexity : 447.2553069436799
Sentence: mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father 's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .
Perplexity : 362.75591567722597
Sentence: `` if i , '' said mr. collins , `` were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .

Sentence: the rector of a parish has much to do .
Perplexity : 325.40144936242854

Sentence: to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .
Perplexity : 374.8395982986555
Sentence: that his two sisters and mr. darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .

Sentence: the rest of the evening brought her little amusement .
Perplexity : 357.1371094972745

Perplexity : 246.16663532928033
Sentence: the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .

Perplexity : 359.450204332155

Sentence: accompanied by a violent yawn .
Perplexity : 1405.2890048464974
Sentence: when at length they arose to take leave , mrs. bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .
Perplexity : 448.06561519978186
Sentence: bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .

Sentence: this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . ''
Perplexity : 411.3952937435608
Sentence: and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr. collins thus addressed her , '' when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . ''
Perplexity : 434.12236864273376
Sentence: `` really , mr. collins , '' cried elizabeth with some warmth , `` you puzzle me exceedingly .
Perplexity : 311.6977417166814

Perplexity : 363.9126007916274
Sentence: `` you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .
Perplexity : 456.0108388183681
Sentence: my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .
Perplexity : 447.8401017514777
Sentence: your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .
Perplexity : 1087.2618447810867
Sentence: as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . ''
Perplexity : 519.9458446008816
Sentence: `` i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .
Perplexity : 470.5732704950611
Sentence: i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .
Perplexity : 560.8983712634233
Sentence: i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .

Perplexity : 569.0155424934733
Sentence: to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .
Perplexity : 690.0235865529387
Sentence: mr. collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .
Perplexity : 633.2483151968124
Sentence: this information , however , startled mrs. bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .
Perplexity : 398.09624460425385
Sentence: `` but depend upon it , mr. collins , '' she added , `` that lizzy shall be brought to reason .
Perplexity : 227.51785869488677
Sentence: she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will make her know it . ''
Perplexity : 310.4099642751809
Sentence: if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . ''
Perplexity : 605.9049912567796
Sentence: `` sir , you quite misunderstand me , '' said mrs. bennet , alarmed .
Perplexity : 286.7408463614621
Sentence: `` lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .
Perplexity : 587.9546037839953
Sentence: in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .
Perplexity : 512.1846518608611
Sentence: i will go directly to mr. bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure . ''
Perplexity : 239.06268822776525

Sentence: mr. bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar .
Perplexity : 388.6397186014897

Perplexity : 276.41297107977056
Sentence: mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .
Perplexity : 490.503562593407
Sentence: `` i have not the pleasure of understanding you , '' said he , when she had finished her speech .

Sentence: from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .
Perplexity : 327.5479374853151
Sentence: your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr. collins , and i will never see you again if you do . ''
Perplexity : 281.04452411743677
Sentence: elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs. bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .
Perplexity : 407.54558543531067
Sentence: `` what do you mean , mr. bennet , by talking in this way ?

Sentence: you promised me to insist upon her marrying him . ''
Perplexity : 430.7312920143483

Perplexity : 353.3112607628487
Sentence: i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . ''
Perplexity : 228.79213753127485
Sentence: not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs. bennet give up the point .
Perplexity : 264.61615807068665
Sentence: she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns .
Perplexity : 516.186043373486
Sentence: she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ; and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .
Perplexity : 854.3269576265343
Sentence: though her manner varied however , her determination never did .
Perplexity : 574.9980075328065
Sentence: mr. collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .
Perplexity : 434.6254175499028

Perplexity : 383.73724261365686
Sentence: charlotte 's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth .
Perplexity : 365.0576147910916
Sentence: but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .

Sentence: i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .
Perplexity : 501.25070850791735

Sentence: those who do not complain are never pitied . ''
Perplexity : 762.3386021900958

Perplexity : 661.8549935495926
Sentence: she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr. collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , '' now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr. collins and me have a little conversation together . ''
Perplexity : 305.7315893363281

Perplexity : 557.9667539092786
Sentence: collins ! ''
Perplexity : 290.6985456539521
Sentence: far be it from me , '' he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , `` to resent the behaviour of your daughter .
Perplexity : 364.79156577503886
Sentence: perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .
Perplexity : 830.0616959031727
Sentence: you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .
Perplexity : 548.1409112679769
Sentence: i have certainly meant well through the whole affair .
Perplexity : 609.7652214990434
Sentence: my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise . ''
Perplexity : 485.55145430286643
Sentence: the discussion of mr. collins 's offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .
Perplexity : 540.9752564747604
Sentence: as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .
Perplexity : 474.21276567186345
Sentence: he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .
Perplexity : 302.4135821384282
Sentence: the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennet 's ill humour or ill health .
Perplexity : 967.891406139942

Perplexity : 392.2775444819244
Sentence: `` i found , '' said he , `` as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr. darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . ''
Perplexity : 275.4087238319013
Sentence: she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .
Perplexity : 425.12908608749296
Sentence: the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady 's fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister 's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .
Perplexity : 756.0790442850913
Sentence: jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .
Perplexity : 519.0922904949578
Sentence: when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , '' this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .
Perplexity : 380.722847840522
Sentence: the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again .
Perplexity : 381.9790097592055
Sentence: you shall hear what she says . ''
Perplexity : 337.74434654086184
Sentence: she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr. hurst had a house .
Perplexity : 546.94210528546
Sentence: the next was in these words .
Perplexity : 287.99343466070366
Sentence: `` i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .
Perplexity : 599.5380499787032
Sentence: i depend on you for that . ''
Perplexity : 162.48426864978558
Sentence: to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley 's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .
Perplexity : 374.0695708046003
Sentence: but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?
Perplexity : 590.4744058909341

Perplexity : 426.66776092426153
Sentence: many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i despair .
Perplexity : 327.35648561261087
Sentence: i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you . ''
Perplexity : 663.3500164104278
Sentence: `` it is evident by this , '' added jane , `` that he comes back no more this winter . ''

Sentence: `` it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should . ''

Perplexity : 258.38204719212763
Sentence: `` mr. darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .
Perplexity : 337.1319702267608
Sentence: i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .
Perplexity : 531.9344782588215
Sentence: i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .
Perplexity : 377.93212700272835
Sentence: my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister 's partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman 's heart .
Perplexity : 507.5112360665149
Sentence: with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? ''

Sentence: `` what think you of this sentence , my dear lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 278.1254542419869
Sentence: said jane as she finished it .
Perplexity : 264.4167993381298
Sentence: `` is it not clear enough ?
Perplexity : 383.69555505849996
Sentence: does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother 's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! )
Perplexity : 573.8846823621442
Sentence: can there be any other opinion on the subject ? ''
Perplexity : 349.92840658202397
Sentence: will you hear it ? ''
Perplexity : 260.2324909788429
Sentence: `` most willingly . ''
Perplexity : 368.68185139736113
Sentence: miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy .
Perplexity : 307.5971609578677
Sentence: she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . ''

Sentence: jane shook her head .

Sentence: `` indeed , jane , you ought to believe me .

Sentence: no one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .
Perplexity : 451.3783618572131
Sentence: miss bingley i am sure can not .
Perplexity : 267.5743014101704
Sentence: could she have seen half as much love in mr. darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .
Perplexity : 377.83240759847735
Sentence: but the case is this .
Perplexity : 188.61694269637687
Sentence: we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way .
Perplexity : 423.98141360338917
Sentence: but , my dearest jane , you can not seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ''
Perplexity : 378.3430317452238
Sentence: `` if we thought alike of miss bingley , '' replied jane , `` your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .
Perplexity : 353.67481745740054
Sentence: but i know the foundation is unjust .
Perplexity : 427.253333948129
Sentence: caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ; and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . ''

Perplexity : 385.6672130287419
Sentence: `` you must decide for yourself , '' said elizabeth , `` and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him . ''

Perplexity : 1174.5837206110448
Sentence: the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .
Perplexity : 547.8309286882032
Sentence: it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline 's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .
Perplexity : 620.8457125251751
Sentence: she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .
Perplexity : 363.90727221753406
Sentence: jane 's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .
Perplexity : 399.00143279827216
Sentence: they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman 's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .
Perplexity : 524.2283462163565
Sentence: after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .
Perplexity : 404.31540378921056
Sentence: the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins .

Sentence: charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .
Perplexity : 400.7686330638876
Sentence: this was very amiable , but charlotte 's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of mr. collins 's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .
Perplexity : 513.5858926351175
Sentence: such was miss lucas 's scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon .
Perplexity : 453.43163779716764
Sentence: but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet .
Perplexity : 551.0495270535546
Sentence: he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday .
Perplexity : 515.447384012625
Sentence: his reception however was of the most flattering kind .

Perplexity : 676.8947113316201
Sentence: but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .
Perplexity : 472.9818549559737
Sentence: in as short a time as mr. collins 's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .
Perplexity : 379.3354613267788
Sentence: sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .
Perplexity : 676.3990318876247
Sentence: mr. collins 's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .
Perplexity : 657.5573879220635
Sentence: lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr. collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st. james 's .
Perplexity : 605.7648836459076
Sentence: the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion .
Perplexity : 649.111723799756
Sentence: the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte 's dying an old maid .
Perplexity : 996.2330107364122
Sentence: her reflections were in general satisfactory .
Perplexity : 630.2971432188916
Sentence: mr. collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .
Perplexity : 415.8202451935264
Sentence: but still he would be her husband .
Perplexity : 235.13363341283966
Sentence: without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .
Perplexity : 753.3125557729128
Sentence: this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .
Perplexity : 458.49509864012373
Sentence: the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .
Perplexity : 405.14378878555186
Sentence: elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .
Perplexity : 357.27109037535627
Sentence: she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr. collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .
Perplexity : 343.4714804783439
Sentence: a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .
Perplexity : 678.8971477473239
Sentence: as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs. bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .
Perplexity : 444.40858967660864
Sentence: `` my dear madam , '' he replied , `` this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . ''
Perplexity : 339.0846317048983
Sentence: they were all astonished ; and mr. bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , '' but is there not danger of lady catherine 's disapprobation here , my good sir ?
Perplexity : 375.4770004927653
Sentence: `` my dear sir , '' replied mr. collins , `` i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship 's concurrence . ''
Perplexity : 447.15664595526255
Sentence: risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . ''
Perplexity : 512.820890875635
Sentence: `` believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire .
Perplexity : 489.0361382870749
Sentence: as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth . ''
Perplexity : 470.5509173178227
Sentence: with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .
Perplexity : 754.5532256893256
Sentence: mrs. bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .
Perplexity : 395.3547160815816
Sentence: she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her 's , he might become a very agreeable companion .
Perplexity : 511.59394349646607
Sentence: miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before .
Perplexity : 467.971209118443
Sentence: the possibility of mr. collins 's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , '' engaged to mr. collins !
Perplexity : 449.6748791609224
Sentence: my dear charlotte , impossible ! ''
Perplexity : 344.6547125451288
Sentence: the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , '' why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ?
Perplexity : 555.4447450596654
Sentence: do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman 's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? ''
Perplexity : 424.4305868580985
Sentence: but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .
Perplexity : 413.85865383413454
Sentence: `` i see what you are feeling , '' replied charlotte , `` you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you .
Perplexity : 278.0079792157631
Sentence: but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done .
Perplexity : 221.6486439035513
Sentence: i am not romantic you know .
Perplexity : 346.53487468620625
Sentence: i never was .
Perplexity : 108.21584603001736
Sentence: i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr. collins 's character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . ''
Perplexity : 434.6493750870733
Sentence: elizabeth quietly answered `` undoubtedly ; '' and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .
Perplexity : 395.1874600544547
Sentence: charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .
Perplexity : 349.9293955263113
Sentence: it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .
Perplexity : 420.56974989338386
Sentence: charlotte the wife of mr. collins , was a most humiliating picture !
Perplexity : 448.3869536725877
Sentence: elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .
Perplexity : 427.7981601802999
Sentence: with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , '' good lord !
Perplexity : 560.2674686254886
Sentence: sir william , how can you tell such a story ?
Perplexity : 539.6798524890639
Sentence: do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 385.1279408943317
Sentence: nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william 's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .
Perplexity : 660.5576500313347
Sentence: in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .
Perplexity : 394.956916129843
Sentence: two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .
Perplexity : 433.51553670834954
Sentence: nothing could console and nothing appease her .
Perplexity : 621.750041773399
Sentence: nor did that day wear out her resentment .
Perplexity : 809.9523830041957
Sentence: a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .
Perplexity : 641.9572444085622
Sentence: mr. bennet 's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !
Perplexity : 401.8744738918055
Sentence: jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .
Perplexity : 466.6954274996605
Sentence: kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr. collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton .
Perplexity : 471.13603999350613
Sentence: lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs. bennet 's sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .
Perplexity : 670.0376127760263
Sentence: her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .
Perplexity : 446.8285419706087
Sentence: jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .
Perplexity : 565.1997213496899
Sentence: after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .
Perplexity : 523.7852600789382
Sentence: mr. collins 's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet .
Perplexity : 414.8855894575999
Sentence: on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .
Perplexity : 288.71841805264796
Sentence: it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .
Perplexity : 549.7907289912397
Sentence: such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley 's continued absence .
Perplexity : 444.6543574212543
Sentence: neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .
Perplexity : 651.5545471571625
Sentence: day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .
Perplexity : 723.3724548717302
Sentence: even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .
Perplexity : 487.5489005471696
Sentence: unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane 's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .
Perplexity : 529.2202682046765
Sentence: as for jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth 's ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .
Perplexity : 307.96875979908094
Sentence: but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .
Perplexity : 497.3493436702266
Sentence: it needed all jane 's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .
Perplexity : 1594.5162437621307
Sentence: mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .
Perplexity : 540.0417263240531
Sentence: he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company .
Perplexity : 367.5315002171976
Sentence: the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .
Perplexity : 440.23659593455466
Sentence: mrs. bennet was really in a most pitiable state .
Perplexity : 527.3399846659452
Sentence: the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .
Perplexity : 494.42000814762673
Sentence: the sight of miss lucas was odious to her .
Perplexity : 282.8178440999851
Sentence: as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .
Perplexity : 506.99069527799367
Sentence: whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr. bennet were dead .
Perplexity : 380.84345313401656
Sentence: she complained bitterly of all this to her husband .
Perplexity : 430.9683945998227
Sentence: `` indeed , mr. bennet , '' said she , `` it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! ''
Perplexity : 243.10351628808965
Sentence: `` my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .

Perplexity : 739.6051845068152
Sentence: let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor . ''
Perplexity : 612.8584224417879
Sentence: this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , '' i can not bear to think that they should have all this estate .
Perplexity : 246.97306417386383
Sentence: if it was not for the entail i should not mind it . ''
Perplexity : 196.44895038420486
Sentence: `` i should not mind any thing at all . ''
Perplexity : 221.76612819373537
Sentence: `` let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . ''
Perplexity : 527.6533601646896
Sentence: `` i never can be thankful , mr. bennet , for any thing about the entail .
Perplexity : 264.18272467192935
Sentence: why should he have it more than anybody else ? ''
Perplexity : 575.8022910584151

Perplexity : 199.85422799607346
Sentence: miss bingley 's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .
Perplexity : 450.71003282101674

Perplexity : 467.4937557967142
Sentence: miss darcy 's praise occupied the chief of it .
Perplexity : 451.6948460903471
Sentence: her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .
Perplexity : 718.163146844596
Sentence: she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother 's being an inmate of mr. darcy 's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .
Perplexity : 515.244514947388
Sentence: elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .
Perplexity : 355.6985435287752
Sentence: her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .
Perplexity : 449.2919970834423
Sentence: to caroline 's assertion of her brother 's being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit .
Perplexity : 538.4524959950272
Sentence: that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations .
Perplexity : 407.48356864808466
Sentence: it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .
Perplexity : 305.28774726412956
Sentence: she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley 's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of jane 's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister 's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .
Perplexity : 559.202144914912
Sentence: a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last on mrs. bennet 's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , '' oh !

Sentence: but i will not repine .

Sentence: without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .

Perplexity : 545.8460254523053
Sentence: mrs. gardiner 's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : '' you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly .

Sentence: while sir william was with them , mr. collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .

Perplexity : 495.18671759849934
Sentence: very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .

Sentence: she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collins 's joints of meat were too large for her family .
Perplexity : 568.2065973929209
Sentence: elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr. collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .
Perplexity : 621.0612722280625
Sentence: the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .

Perplexity : 511.4341645724756
Sentence: this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .
Perplexity : 399.6836295847311
Sentence: her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine 's curiosity .

Perplexity : 408.1412170250883

Perplexity : 405.9526830726225
Sentence: elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr. darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley 's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself .
Perplexity : 428.7109232615584
Sentence: his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr. collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence .

Sentence: on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects .

Perplexity : 357.7380400976329

Sentence: have you never happened to see her there ? ''
Perplexity : 282.995210417134
Sentence: she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet .
Perplexity : 414.2285192812553

Perplexity : 484.8057102610259
Sentence: it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen 's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .
Perplexity : 386.6336762640569

Sentence: he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr. darcy .

Perplexity : 495.5738916890373
Sentence: indeed , mr. darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . ''
Perplexity : 369.22827718324515
Sentence: `` i am not afraid of you , '' said he , smilingly .
Perplexity : 164.77352039480667
Sentence: `` pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , '' cried colonel fitzwilliam .

Sentence: no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .

Perplexity : 417.42711112674965
Sentence: elizabeth immediately began playing again .
Perplexity : 993.7317283842352
Sentence: she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne 's .
Perplexity : 448.74654525947193
Sentence: anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . ''
Perplexity : 505.862891784647
Sentence: elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin 's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .
Perplexity : 436.59120433801627
Sentence: lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth 's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .
Perplexity : 935.3962435947481
Sentence: elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .
Perplexity : 406.9820008778978
Sentence: as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr. darcy , and mr. darcy only , entered the room .
Perplexity : 340.5862308177177
Sentence: he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .
Perplexity : 455.2209615606089
Sentence: they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .
Perplexity : 647.0308250268113
Sentence: it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , '' how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 412.4855490749419
Sentence: it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before .
Perplexity : 279.48989510286003
Sentence: he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london . ''
Perplexity : 194.74429775221296
Sentence: `` perfectly so i thank you . ''
Perplexity : 248.1666064184214
Sentence: `` i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .
Perplexity : 335.9694994480986
Sentence: he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . ''
Perplexity : 399.6864195286003
Sentence: `` if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .
Perplexity : 356.20817951146245
Sentence: but perhaps mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . ''
Perplexity : 353.3496215158734
Sentence: `` i should not be surprised , '' said darcy , `` if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . ''
Perplexity : 264.8907221376002
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer .
Perplexity : 361.7637881482048
Sentence: she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .
Perplexity : 284.9827371900319
Sentence: he took the hint , and soon began with , `` this seems a very comfortable house .
Perplexity : 322.79637157029265
Sentence: `` mr. collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . ''
Perplexity : 432.47755151298986
Sentence: `` yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .
Perplexity : 417.5324732899455
Sentence: my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did .
Perplexity : 497.7318647794751
Sentence: she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . ''
Perplexity : 302.0063247477906
Sentence: `` it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . ''
Perplexity : 292.0815924106519
Sentence: `` an easy distance do you call it ?
Perplexity : 670.4215780040813
Sentence: it is nearly fifty miles . ''
Perplexity : 765.9413887799358
Sentence: `` and what is fifty miles of good road ?
Perplexity : 606.6477879343355
Sentence: little more than half a day 's journey .
Perplexity : 501.60511034290676
Sentence: `` i should never have said mrs. collins was settled near her family . ''
Perplexity : 302.51953522922634
Sentence: `` it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire .
Perplexity : 311.6704057243842
Sentence: any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far . ''
Perplexity : 328.2484676880803
Sentence: as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , '' i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .
Perplexity : 302.2984331779617
Sentence: the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .
Perplexity : 506.08851449553697
Sentence: but that is not the case here .
Perplexity : 202.55887681620837
Sentence: mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . ''
Perplexity : 511.1395153813669
Sentence: mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , `` you can not have a right to such very strong local attachment .
Perplexity : 357.47452724587
Sentence: you can not have been always at longbourn . ''
Perplexity : 227.32766950520517
Sentence: the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , '' are you pleased with kent ? ''
Perplexity : 458.26099781653613
Sentence: a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .
Perplexity : 521.547657724707
Sentence: the tte  tte surprised them .
Perplexity : 1370.7254690749503
Sentence: mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .
Perplexity : 605.6905653937151
Sentence: `` what can be the meaning of this ! ''
Perplexity : 229.48932710702616
Sentence: said charlotte , as soon as he was gone .
Perplexity : 200.481672968174
Sentence: `` my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . ''
Perplexity : 334.59140515331876
Sentence: but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte 's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .
Perplexity : 348.203366611432
Sentence: all field sports were over .
Perplexity : 1589.2337203411716
Sentence: within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen can not be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .
Perplexity : 431.5112624293592
Sentence: they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .
Perplexity : 512.5407252866653
Sentence: it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam 's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .
Perplexity : 436.18807094407015
Sentence: but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .
Perplexity : 323.6797133673118
Sentence: it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .
Perplexity : 446.04455120071367
Sentence: he seldom appeared really animated .
Perplexity : 1677.4197168002863
Sentence: mrs. collins knew not what to make of him .
Perplexity : 224.25804140105495
Sentence: colonel fitzwilliam 's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .
Perplexity : 368.7814079348266
Sentence: she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success .
Perplexity : 446.25244227416135
Sentence: it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .
Perplexity : 480.1182891168384
Sentence: she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend 's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .
Perplexity : 374.7381222505651
Sentence: in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .
Perplexity : 572.3060809348726
Sentence: he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .
Perplexity : 452.4548955483347
Sentence: more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 598.1289518433234
Sentence: she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .
Perplexity : 548.9822801210462
Sentence: how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !
Perplexity : 814.8712477437322
Sentence: yet it did , and even a third .
Perplexity : 274.2434083960207
Sentence: it seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .
Perplexity : 661.5711424847956
Sentence: he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collins 's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too .
Perplexity : 447.69455787069774
Sentence: his words seemed to imply it .
Perplexity : 528.597020582395
Sentence: she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .
Perplexity : 456.01951752449406
Sentence: it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage .
Perplexity : 377.2668375910422
Sentence: she was engaged one day as she walked , in re perusing jane 's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .
Perplexity : 472.7165746203586
Sentence: putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , '' i did not know before that you ever walked this way . ''
Perplexity : 345.59724625497375
Sentence: are you going much farther ? ''
Perplexity : 505.1860597648563
Sentence: `` no , i should have turned in a moment . ''
Perplexity : 169.87105866484075
Sentence: and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .
Perplexity : 437.91205802976367
Sentence: `` do you certainly leave kent on saturday ? ''
Perplexity : 672.3701300929708
Sentence: said she .
Perplexity : 103.83972272163977
Sentence: `` yes if darcy does not put it off again .
Perplexity : 465.9222035045339
Sentence: but i am at his disposal .
Perplexity : 297.33127386262396
Sentence: he arranges the business just as he pleases . ''
Perplexity : 563.4641020514216
Sentence: `` and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice .
Perplexity : 327.52915693040484
Sentence: i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr .
Perplexity : 577.6994688852659
Sentence: `` he likes to have his own way very well , '' replied colonel fitzwilliam .
Perplexity : 343.37890674719125
Sentence: `` but so we all do .
Perplexity : 185.99609756763348
Sentence: `` in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .
Perplexity : 367.8345345925784
Sentence: now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ?
Perplexity : 570.4054680566019
Sentence: `` these are home questions and perhaps i can not say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature .
Perplexity : 537.1733312822566
Sentence: but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money .
Perplexity : 444.9472357259863
Sentence: younger sons can not marry where they like . ''
Perplexity : 786.5475192189617
Sentence: `` unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do . ''
Perplexity : 386.7814456730315
Sentence: `` our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . ''
Perplexity : 611.7626320206876
Sentence: `` is this , '' thought elizabeth , `` meant for me ? ''
Perplexity : 180.74613939653185
Sentence: and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , `` and pray , what is the usual price of an earl 's younger son ?
Perplexity : 426.9124899592338
Sentence: he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .
Perplexity : 307.2722956941262
Sentence: to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , '' i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .
Perplexity : 509.1109228350845
Sentence: but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . ''
Perplexity : 242.51718951298955
Sentence: `` no , '' said colonel fitzwilliam , `` that is an advantage which he must divide with me .

Sentence: `` are you , indeed ?
Perplexity : 190.45907949153542
Sentence: does your charge give you much trouble ?
Perplexity : 1063.409954709778
Sentence: as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .
Perplexity : 462.8401632404683
Sentence: she directly replied , '' you need not be frightened .
Perplexity : 345.7678314967425
Sentence: i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .
Perplexity : 371.5968719467672
Sentence: she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs. hurst and miss bingley .
Perplexity : 310.1843745143961
Sentence: i think i have heard you say that you know them . ''
Perplexity : 202.77013483086967
Sentence: `` i know them a little .
Perplexity : 167.76140665772786
Sentence: their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy 's . ''
Perplexity : 363.92103642312713
Sentence: yes , '' said elizabeth drily `` mr. darcy is uncommonly kind to mr. bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . ''
Perplexity : 382.902624178101
Sentence: `` care of him !
Perplexity : 267.10396858436565
Sentence: yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .
Perplexity : 700.9103344434585
Sentence: `` what is it you mean ? ''
Perplexity : 233.7380664114967
Sentence: `` it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady 's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . ''
Perplexity : 300.2942349115797
Sentence: `` and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley .
Perplexity : 227.91550921173834
Sentence: what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . ''
Perplexity : 479.2948368102264
Sentence: `` did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? ''
Perplexity : 468.2618802042505
Sentence: `` i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . ''
Perplexity : 442.35208451406754

Perplexity : 328.1371863113662
Sentence: `` he only told me , what i have now told you . ''
Perplexity : 204.1693766305087
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .
Perplexity : 414.94509813871576
Sentence: `` i am thinking of what you have been telling me , '' said she .
Perplexity : 214.23363882199996
Sentence: `` your cousin 's conduct does not suit my feelings .
Perplexity : 631.5009746012155
Sentence: why was he to be the judge ? ''
Perplexity : 223.9926425246651
Sentence: `` i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend 's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . ''
Perplexity : 329.48063088402836
Sentence: `` but , '' she continued , recollecting herself , `` as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .
Perplexity : 238.47243672339224
Sentence: it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . ''
Perplexity : 204.12869131236963
Sentence: `` that is not an unnatural surmise , '' said fitzwilliam , `` but it is lessening the honour of my cousin 's triumph very sadly . ''
Perplexity : 424.4100699951997
Sentence: this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr. darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .
Perplexity : 434.46080812643464
Sentence: there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .
Perplexity : 323.3154886098401
Sentence: there could not exist in the world two men , over whom mr. darcy could have such boundless influence .
Perplexity : 626.4972489124466
Sentence: that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr. bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .
Perplexity : 385.19573379564997
Sentence: if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .
Perplexity : 311.9744527994072
Sentence: he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .
Perplexity : 527.6761715117399
Sentence: `` there were some very strong objections against the lady , '' were colonel fitzwilliam 's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london .
Perplexity : 470.83086994882024
Sentence: `` to jane herself , '' she exclaimed , `` there could be no possibility of objection .
Perplexity : 230.41180701144552
Sentence: all loveliness and goodness as she is !
Perplexity : 515.9413103424828
Sentence: her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .
Perplexity : 462.5146143217737
Sentence: neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . ''
Perplexity : 580.4380174699996
Sentence: when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr. darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend 's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister .
Perplexity : 427.5125082922952
Sentence: the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .
Perplexity : 446.8147992355073
Sentence: mrs. collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr. collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine 's being rather displeased by her staying at home .
Perplexity : 436.06782449713677
Sentence: when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent .
Perplexity : 405.13888501113604
Sentence: they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .
Perplexity : 1114.6594748803877
Sentence: but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .
Perplexity : 419.1311713943663
Sentence: elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .
Perplexity : 662.8797012084043
Sentence: mr. darcy 's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister 's sufferings .
Perplexity : 595.9986111009549
Sentence: it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .
Perplexity : 289.849693967258
Sentence: she could not think of darcy 's leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .
Perplexity : 322.27905423754476
Sentence: while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .
Perplexity : 513.8256212242926
Sentence: but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr. darcy walk into the room .
Perplexity : 375.80356876441533
Sentence: in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .
Perplexity : 538.1615594443026
Sentence: he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .
Perplexity : 535.9946654657001
Sentence: elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .
Perplexity : 188.40753495796602
Sentence: after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , '' in vain have i struggled .
Perplexity : 478.14681685118836
Sentence: my feelings will not be repressed .
Perplexity : 421.0304621944997
Sentence: you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you . ''
Perplexity : 386.12114879195406
Sentence: elizabeth 's astonishment was beyond expression .
Perplexity : 600.409056602716
Sentence: she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .
Perplexity : 302.90695692691213
Sentence: this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .
Perplexity : 363.2760633257983
Sentence: he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .
Perplexity : 359.4073329244366
Sentence: his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .
Perplexity : 606.3358327865004
Sentence: in spite of her deeply rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man 's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .
Perplexity : 452.07720275749733
Sentence: she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .
Perplexity : 312.0486845363446
Sentence: he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .
Perplexity : 408.3630899468942
Sentence: as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .
Perplexity : 279.8245620665601
Sentence: he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .
Perplexity : 666.046539260234
Sentence: such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , '' in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .
Perplexity : 426.0789060772191
Sentence: it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you .
Perplexity : 338.44877067870715
Sentence: i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .
Perplexity : 399.012729986638
Sentence: it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration .
Perplexity : 363.7085496659885
Sentence: the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . ''
Perplexity : 405.4027375860595
Sentence: his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .
Perplexity : 729.1755315038547
Sentence: he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .
Perplexity : 393.2588504775934
Sentence: the pause was to elizabeth 's feelings dreadful .
Perplexity : 341.7581107212835
Sentence: at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , '' and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !
Perplexity : 260.33989400864834
Sentence: i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected .
Perplexity : 360.25684370568473
Sentence: `` i might as well enquire , '' replied she , `` why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?
Perplexity : 405.5825329561266
Sentence: was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil ?
Perplexity : 458.72991669819
Sentence: but i have other provocations .
Perplexity : 391.4291070390853
Sentence: you know i have .
Perplexity : 126.6485109280031
Sentence: had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? ''
Perplexity : 384.6610012927403
Sentence: as she pronounced these words , mr. darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .
Perplexity : 545.3937413636244
Sentence: no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .
Perplexity : 1007.58115256479
Sentence: you dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . ''
Perplexity : 414.50735905315076
Sentence: he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .
Perplexity : 474.456281763049
Sentence: `` can you deny that you have done it ? ''
Perplexity : 282.38838214260176
Sentence: she repeated .
Perplexity : 276.5449021713161
Sentence: with assumed tranquillity he then replied , `` i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success .
Perplexity : 435.1427979419899
Sentence: towards him i have been kinder than towards myself . ''
Perplexity : 498.66707657881665
Sentence: elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .
Perplexity : 668.4856512162343
Sentence: `` but it is not merely this affair , '' she continued , `` on which my dislike is founded .
Perplexity : 283.8529909582091
Sentence: long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .
Perplexity : 328.01608427462423
Sentence: your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 653.863898754112
Sentence: on this subject , what can you have to say ?
Perplexity : 230.18567391066745
Sentence: or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? ''
Perplexity : 975.0333473091898
Sentence: `` who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? ''
Perplexity : 475.016334634999
Sentence: repeated darcy contemptuously ; `` yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . ''
Perplexity : 516.8792460877016
Sentence: `` you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .
Perplexity : 654.3406095085414
Sentence: you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .
Perplexity : 319.32765565500165
Sentence: you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .
Perplexity : 480.4781492362483
Sentence: you have done all this !
Perplexity : 317.19879614462866
Sentence: and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . ''
Perplexity : 508.13879238843657
Sentence: `` and this , '' cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , '' is your opinion of me !
Perplexity : 296.0342400218215
Sentence: this is the estimation in which you hold me !
Perplexity : 464.8643768554343
Sentence: my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !
Perplexity : 864.8332999398958
Sentence: but perhaps , '' added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , `` these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .
Perplexity : 564.248342832812
Sentence: these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing .
Perplexity : 802.520317584958
Sentence: but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .
Perplexity : 614.1804167587859
Sentence: nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .
Perplexity : 367.95879507775675
Sentence: they were natural and just .
Perplexity : 335.04333382748734
Sentence: could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?
Perplexity : 500.084207975551
Sentence: to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? ''
Perplexity : 668.1795113196983
Sentence: elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , '' you are mistaken , mr. darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ''
Perplexity : 414.78481987926546
Sentence: she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , '' you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ''
Perplexity : 282.7106497202082
Sentence: again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .
Perplexity : 620.2663599003239
Sentence: she went on .
Perplexity : 195.42963953480267
Sentence: `` from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry . ''
Perplexity : 425.06053360019473
Sentence: `` you have said quite enough , madam .
Perplexity : 274.52964902426345
Sentence: forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . ''
Perplexity : 477.9503502093552
Sentence: and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .
Perplexity : 477.2345506274756
Sentence: the tumult of her mind was now painfully great .
Perplexity : 514.705704117545
Sentence: she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .
Perplexity : 581.9323550411793
Sentence: her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .
Perplexity : 345.6516808842609
Sentence: that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 445.4708747468205
Sentence: that he should have been in love with her for so many months !
Perplexity : 311.1233589826924
Sentence: so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend 's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !
Perplexity : 429.69408828984706
Sentence: it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .
Perplexity : 836.4219949073147
Sentence: she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine 's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte 's observation , and hurried her away to her room .
Perplexity : 577.6416906642922
Sentence: elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .
Perplexity : 666.4088184480044
Sentence: she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr. darcy 's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .
Perplexity : 480.4852469638208
Sentence: the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .
Perplexity : 480.4713447095873
Sentence: after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .
Perplexity : 457.9244161156779
Sentence: the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .
Perplexity : 413.028017536318
Sentence: she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr. darcy , she was directly retreating .
Perplexity : 460.15021999241077
Sentence: she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy , she moved again towards the gate .
Perplexity : 350.6731940411373
Sentence: he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , `` i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .
Perplexity : 353.34313793172703
Sentence: will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? ''
Perplexity : 333.95279891787595
Sentence: and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .
Perplexity : 326.2968909431161
Sentence: with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand .
Perplexity : 580.8203582986172
Sentence: the envelope itself was likewise full .
Perplexity : 1171.2572965188456
Sentence: pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .
Perplexity : 500.67481612725527
Sentence: it was dated from rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows : `` be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you .
Perplexity : 523.629323539005
Sentence: i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .
Perplexity : 371.2405188257403

Perplexity : 363.3881254515196
Sentence: `` two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .
Perplexity : 530.4825625448555
Sentence: the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr. bingley from your sister , and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 338.7767875781914
Sentence: but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .
Perplexity : 618.6804937140823
Sentence: if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your 's , i can only say that i am sorry .
Perplexity : 332.0646455959005
Sentence: the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd .
Perplexity : 812.9575889548954

Perplexity : 303.8910207582853
Sentence: at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas 's accidental information , that bingley 's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .
Perplexity : 396.64444749881426
Sentence: he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .
Perplexity : 311.30988110601743
Sentence: from that moment i observed my friend 's behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him .
Perplexity : 470.7484696071978
Sentence: your sister i also watched .
Perplexity : 605.4189075963939

Perplexity : 501.23184874814973
Sentence: if you have not been mistaken here , i must have been in an error .
Perplexity : 297.54805840758024
Sentence: your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .
Perplexity : 692.8052615765243
Sentence: if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .
Perplexity : 387.036209166155
Sentence: but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister 's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .
Perplexity : 413.3909728854769
Sentence: that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .
Perplexity : 672.9311112598053
Sentence: i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ; i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason .
Perplexity : 381.69793406359673
Sentence: my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .
Perplexity : 443.85749995808925
Sentence: but there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .
Perplexity : 579.894190812366
Sentence: these causes must be stated , though briefly .
Perplexity : 1072.8650050389426

Sentence: pardon me .
Perplexity : 465.41329999396277
Sentence: it pains me to offend you .
Perplexity : 470.9728853574994
Sentence: but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .
Perplexity : 515.0139143678502
Sentence: i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .

Perplexity : 273.16898567697217

Sentence: we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .
Perplexity : 509.7055277410852
Sentence: he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .
Perplexity : 363.19630151744775
Sentence: but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .
Perplexity : 639.4350324390841
Sentence: to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .
Perplexity : 296.9168197163628
Sentence: there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town .
Perplexity : 419.31928733517105
Sentence: i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .
Perplexity : 242.0404821321868
Sentence: that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .
Perplexity : 499.29991929318936
Sentence: perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .
Perplexity : 572.1092214743658

Perplexity : 318.3752183126843
Sentence: if i have wounded your sister 's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them .
Perplexity : 522.3697726019169
Sentence: with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr. wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .
Perplexity : 454.7857746513515
Sentence: of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .
Perplexity : 589.829250083047
Sentence: mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .
Perplexity : 445.24559296703336
Sentence: my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education .
Perplexity : 518.1741166736803
Sentence: the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr. darcy could not have .
Perplexity : 474.7923733214999
Sentence: here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell .
Perplexity : 483.8824983486152
Sentence: but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .
Perplexity : 666.1430115959784
Sentence: my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .
Perplexity : 485.87218009849465
Sentence: his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr. wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .
Perplexity : 619.8586680497658
Sentence: he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .
Perplexity : 427.9749442409179
Sentence: i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman .
Perplexity : 282.46734042920275
Sentence: the business was therefore soon settled .
Perplexity : 374.9553097815145

Perplexity : 425.1099149380792

Perplexity : 360.5712451268696
Sentence: his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .
Perplexity : 312.4255023461441
Sentence: he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions .
Perplexity : 435.2663479341296
Sentence: you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .
Perplexity : 706.4699662692417
Sentence: after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .
Perplexity : 522.9631563192528
Sentence: how he lived i know not .
Perplexity : 277.0833921809623
Sentence: but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
Perplexity : 881.8426369982724
Sentence: i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .
Perplexity : 566.3334488986668
Sentence: having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy .
Perplexity : 477.754229011933
Sentence: my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .
Perplexity : 368.22682923286754
Sentence: about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .
Perplexity : 519.681671222821
Sentence: she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .
Perplexity : 299.68275273796417
Sentence: i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .
Perplexity : 511.9564499104497
Sentence: you may imagine what i felt and how i acted .
Perplexity : 381.61357333817494
Sentence: regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge .
Perplexity : 491.2905562895571
Sentence: mr. wickham 's chief object was unquestionably my sister 's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .
Perplexity : 584.5611389922135
Sentence: his revenge would have been complete indeed .
Perplexity : 771.3608057860357
Sentence: this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 480.43757601836666
Sentence: i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .
Perplexity : 384.7060321435423
Sentence: ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .
Perplexity : 497.9158074796072
Sentence: you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .
Perplexity : 570.0196388468902
Sentence: but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .
Perplexity : 342.6378288577574
Sentence: for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .
Perplexity : 559.9732211565214
Sentence: if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .
Perplexity : 472.3665318596427
Sentence: i will only add , god bless you .
Perplexity : 592.7416772012299
Sentence: `` fitzwilliam darcy . ''
Perplexity : 209.71472839031463
Sentence: if elizabeth , when mr. darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .
Perplexity : 350.8688527040699
Sentence: but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .
Perplexity : 426.04553281312286
Sentence: her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .
Perplexity : 394.7003083607432
Sentence: with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .
Perplexity : 425.9002677496418
Sentence: she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .
Perplexity : 435.0125717479397
Sentence: his belief of her sister 's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .
Perplexity : 350.1562223579952
Sentence: he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .
Perplexity : 468.2437654067312
Sentence: it was all pride and insolence .
Perplexity : 349.90300489566687
Sentence: but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .
Perplexity : 604.955743867307
Sentence: astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .
Perplexity : 416.05608579087493
Sentence: this must be the grossest falsehood ! ''
Perplexity : 641.2683198663788
Sentence: and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .
Perplexity : 375.46479431603984
Sentence: in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .
Perplexity : 401.15556616723853
Sentence: the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .
Perplexity : 360.7020007187236
Sentence: so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .
Perplexity : 439.34366327666896
Sentence: what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .
Perplexity : 365.02197896160925
Sentence: but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham 's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .
Perplexity : 541.5497527329385
Sentence: she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success .
Perplexity : 745.73293912497
Sentence: again she read on .
Perplexity : 289.7053426770524
Sentence: but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr. darcy 's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .
Perplexity : 617.5259919798981
Sentence: the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr. wickham 's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .
Perplexity : 528.272983551934
Sentence: of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself .
Perplexity : 332.9997269794034
Sentence: as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .
Perplexity : 275.86378421358364
Sentence: his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .
Perplexity : 319.566944211178
Sentence: she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .
Perplexity : 759.3799466065967
Sentence: but no such recollection befriended her .
Perplexity : 618.1473500212243
Sentence: after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .
Perplexity : 617.0103389136843
Sentence: but , alas !
Perplexity : 444.2020222547856
Sentence: the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin 's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .
Perplexity : 518.9970561220584
Sentence: at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin 's corroboration .
Perplexity : 452.2584750898597
Sentence: she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr. philips 's .
Perplexity : 427.0440100154122
Sentence: many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .
Perplexity : 570.8253814021433
Sentence: she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .
Perplexity : 429.116502696513
Sentence: she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr. darcy that mr. darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week .
Perplexity : 474.2676705587997
Sentence: she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr. darcy 's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .
Perplexity : 407.68391220408887
Sentence: how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !
Perplexity : 694.6242350121639
Sentence: his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .
Perplexity : 644.7046141965451
Sentence: his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn .
Perplexity : 582.1838660686922
Sentence: every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of mr. darcy , she could not but allow that mr. bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .
Perplexity : 580.581264421567
Sentence: that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling .
Perplexity : 498.61693085212926
Sentence: that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr. bingley , was incomprehensible .
Perplexity : 469.4181853914975
Sentence: she grew absolutely ashamed of herself .
Perplexity : 765.6701830136009
Sentence: of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .
Perplexity : 427.1392891635157
Sentence: `` how despicably have i acted ! ''
Perplexity : 654.6222864255752
Sentence: i , who have valued myself on my abilities !
Perplexity : 523.4243119197093
Sentence: who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust .
Perplexity : 826.0937124737603
Sentence: how humiliating is this discovery !
Perplexity : 1516.7653608383275
Sentence: yet , how just a humiliation !
Perplexity : 681.4458301680236
Sentence: had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind .
Perplexity : 305.7694348608003
Sentence: but vanity , not love , has been my folly .
Perplexity : 291.3198368873418
Sentence: pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .
Perplexity : 412.229061470406
Sentence: till this moment , i never knew myself . ''
Perplexity : 325.647142154987
Sentence: from herself to jane from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy 's explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again .
Perplexity : 330.5730112382496
Sentence: widely different was the effect of a second perusal .
Perplexity : 741.8646975183165

Perplexity : 452.9553762203152
Sentence: elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .
Perplexity : 552.1018762993019
Sentence: elizabeth 's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr. darcy and herself .
Perplexity : 413.8608886191246
Sentence: miss bennet 's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .
Perplexity : 831.844306517307
Sentence: she was sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister 's refusal must have given him .

Perplexity : 947.4788959716099

Perplexity : 456.5532677325372
Sentence: most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .
Perplexity : 614.4795493123734
Sentence: `` this will not do , '' said elizabeth .

Sentence: `` you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .

Perplexity : 344.8407294221388
Sentence: there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .
Perplexity : 546.4661329515478
Sentence: for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr. darcy 's , but you shall do as you chuse . ''
Perplexity : 236.02722306271397
Sentence: it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane .

Sentence: and poor mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 338.39583815833265
Sentence: such a disappointment !
Perplexity : 568.6705484861732
Sentence: and having to relate such a thing of his sister !
Perplexity : 294.7978892501536
Sentence: it is really too distressing .
Perplexity : 563.480478217052
Sentence: i am sure you must feel it so . ''
Perplexity : 249.648794606205
Sentence: no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .
Perplexity : 441.5222276224215
Sentence: i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .
Perplexity : 617.1575579490018
Sentence: your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . ''
Perplexity : 665.2225773305676
Sentence: `` poor wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !
Perplexity : 499.29651652835116
Sentence: such an openness and gentleness in his manner . ''
Perplexity : 464.34644401819145
Sentence: `` there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .
Perplexity : 605.1146881668315

Sentence: `` i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . ''
Perplexity : 253.61299615544223
Sentence: `` and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .
Perplexity : 445.4782204931783
Sentence: it is such a spur to one 's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .
Perplexity : 402.1164031021015
Sentence: one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . ''
Perplexity : 780.1631943778747
Sentence: `` lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . ''
Perplexity : 276.2154596375235
Sentence: `` indeed i could not .
Perplexity : 149.56053433470953
Sentence: i was uncomfortable enough .
Perplexity : 330.3366423564117
Sentence: i was very uncomfortable , i may say unhappy .
Perplexity : 318.22669244973775
Sentence: and with no one to speak to , of what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had !
Perplexity : 238.41050377038977
Sentence: how i wanted you ! ''
Perplexity : 327.3755647247055
Sentence: `` how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved . ''
Perplexity : 524.0378868971712
Sentence: `` certainly .
Perplexity : 184.6482499001145
Sentence: but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging .
Perplexity : 465.7188396484583
Sentence: there is one point , on which i want your advice .
Perplexity : 347.203242942153
Sentence: i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham 's character . ''
Perplexity : 426.0884584377888
Sentence: miss bennet paused a little and then replied , `` surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .
Perplexity : 622.342432842818
Sentence: what is your own opinion ? ''
Perplexity : 383.7405510905896
Sentence: `` that it ought not to be attempted .
Perplexity : 222.9050605435651
Sentence: mr. darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .
Perplexity : 560.0364518295447
Sentence: the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .
Perplexity : 381.6922252872264
Sentence: i am not equal to it .
Perplexity : 155.51354601839995
Sentence: wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .
Perplexity : 373.44926040908234
Sentence: sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .
Perplexity : 606.4089960862744
Sentence: `` you are quite right .
Perplexity : 324.4928164883665
Sentence: to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .
Perplexity : 658.2015994826322
Sentence: he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character .
Perplexity : 473.0077311540912
Sentence: we must not make him desperate . ''
Perplexity : 397.28140843928924
Sentence: but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .
Perplexity : 945.7481998052485
Sentence: she dared not relate the other half of mr. darcy 's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .
Perplexity : 442.225146735492
Sentence: here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .
Perplexity : 773.4170246761323
Sentence: `` and then , '' said she , `` if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .
Perplexity : 361.59595383431247
Sentence: the liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value ! ''
Perplexity : 697.9649901182404
Sentence: jane was not happy .
Perplexity : 191.4469579387493
Sentence: she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .
Perplexity : 684.4988084502235
Sentence: having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .
Perplexity : 483.4058992717747
Sentence: `` well , lizzy , '' said mrs. bennet one day , `` what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane 's ?
Perplexity : 293.06191323473524
Sentence: for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .
Perplexity : 280.46685723661557
Sentence: i told my sister philips so the other day .
Perplexity : 353.2191140686635
Sentence: but i can not find out that jane saw any thing of him in london .
Perplexity : 294.7888542633632
Sentence: well , he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .
Perplexity : 334.2476720965664
Sentence: there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . ''
Perplexity : 293.05078224399904
Sentence: `` i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more . ''
Perplexity : 303.7035000787193
Sentence: `` oh , well !
Perplexity : 266.8385589568335
Sentence: it is just as he chooses .
Perplexity : 386.60196148640625
Sentence: nobody wants him to come .
Perplexity : 594.6751271507236
Sentence: though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .
Perplexity : 287.9644295604021
Sentence: well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . ''
Perplexity : 312.60680378673146
Sentence: but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .
Perplexity : 378.2630905246565
Sentence: `` well , lizzy , '' continued her mother soon afterwards , `` and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ?
Perplexity : 306.200592244785
Sentence: well , well , i only hope it will last .
Perplexity : 190.28542979867183
Sentence: charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say .

Sentence: there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , i dare say . ''
Perplexity : 438.8822932272538
Sentence: `` no , nothing at all . ''
Perplexity : 123.63561322727175
Sentence: `` a great deal of good management , depend upon it .
Perplexity : 416.6377101437259
Sentence: yes , yes .
Perplexity : 215.51953755169606
Sentence: they will never be distressed for money .
Perplexity : 458.89884392537465
Sentence: well , much good may it do them !
Perplexity : 294.61251307357503
Sentence: `` it was a subject which they could not mention before me . ''
Perplexity : 224.06308771125066
Sentence: `` no .
Perplexity : 98.50146278825932
Sentence: but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .
Perplexity : 366.01658748955447
Sentence: well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .
Perplexity : 329.9340211990356
Sentence: the first week of their return was soon gone .
Perplexity : 360.5313430506846
Sentence: it was the last of the regiment 's stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .
Perplexity : 344.8984546974597
Sentence: the dejection was almost universal .
Perplexity : 898.6304250934581
Sentence: the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .
Perplexity : 651.9811962888119
Sentence: very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family .
Perplexity : 572.0344951536451
Sentence: `` good heaven !
Perplexity : 746.7821856420065
Sentence: what is to become of us !
Perplexity : 355.60104973137834
Sentence: what are we to do ! ''
Perplexity : 237.64921259788156
Sentence: would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .
Perplexity : 781.8488257786533
Sentence: `` how can you be smiling so , lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 285.5134740488361
Sentence: their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .
Perplexity : 956.0524931278018
Sentence: `` i am sure , '' said she , `` i cried for two days together when colonel millar 's regiment went away .
Perplexity : 425.0673097422077
Sentence: i thought i should have broke my heart . ''
Perplexity : 365.89106789075817
Sentence: `` i am sure i shall break mine , '' said lydia .

Sentence: `` if one could but go to brighton ! ''
Perplexity : 316.831195635838
Sentence: `` oh , yes !
Perplexity : 333.80430895188977
Sentence: if one could but go to brighton !

Sentence: but papa is so disagreeable . ''
Perplexity : 468.92436931651827
Sentence: `` a little sea bathing would set me up for ever . ''
Perplexity : 677.9554391350842
Sentence: `` and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , '' added kitty .
Perplexity : 317.6932255576063
Sentence: such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house .
Perplexity : 1231.9162862874687
Sentence: elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .
Perplexity : 453.86158557147826
Sentence: she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy 's objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .
Perplexity : 419.7549810087858
Sentence: but the gloom of lydia 's prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs. forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton .
Perplexity : 396.19893646155106
Sentence: this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .
Perplexity : 471.40710828819465
Sentence: a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two .
Perplexity : 507.0103245591423
Sentence: the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs. forster , the delight of mrs. bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described .
Perplexity : 304.7315439646905
Sentence: wholly inattentive to her sister 's feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one 's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .
Perplexity : 873.3448612815818
Sentence: `` i can not see why mrs. forster should not ask me as well as lydia , '' said she , `` though i am not her particular friend .
Perplexity : 269.37679626324484
Sentence: i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older . ''
Perplexity : 285.019374980226
Sentence: in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned .
Perplexity : 330.45636852601393
Sentence: she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia 's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .
Perplexity : 453.6592647196139
Sentence: he heard her attentively , and then said , '' lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ''
Perplexity : 432.06286972012344
Sentence: `` if you were aware , '' said elizabeth , `` of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia 's unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair . ''
Perplexity : 393.04190878147614
Sentence: `` already arisen ! ''
Perplexity : 825.6312845834157
Sentence: repeated mr. bennet .

Sentence: `` what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?
Perplexity : 459.3481362020789
Sentence: poor little lizzy !
Perplexity : 1160.1612155374778
Sentence: but do not be cast down .
Perplexity : 421.698665353102
Sentence: such squeamish youths as can not bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .
Perplexity : 693.0506864608458
Sentence: `` indeed you are mistaken .
Perplexity : 350.73786916634515
Sentence: i have no such injuries to resent .

Perplexity : 271.4212664620828

Sentence: `` he is the best landlord , and the best master , '' said she , `` that ever lived .

Perplexity : 494.34598561030504
Sentence: in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy 's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .
Perplexity : 590.2496118781107
Sentence: in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .
Perplexity : 425.595755218875
Sentence: elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .
Perplexity : 432.1064168459044

Perplexity : 700.0899036838781

Perplexity : 389.5864802374592
Sentence: the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds was of no trifling nature .
Perplexity : 669.3562948474909
Sentence: as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people 's happiness were in his guardianship !
Perplexity : 415.5164019187498
Sentence: how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow !
Perplexity : 419.8786705856719
Sentence: how much of good or evil must be done by him !
Perplexity : 461.4748350667399
Sentence: every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .
Perplexity : 495.12468267613195
Sentence: when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .
Perplexity : 446.2797335822701
Sentence: their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .
Perplexity : 701.0271095145722
Sentence: he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .
Perplexity : 500.78289913460935
Sentence: she had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .
Perplexity : 585.4773617605033
Sentence: they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .
Perplexity : 517.580213025622
Sentence: amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .
Perplexity : 424.82495051447995
Sentence: nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .
Perplexity : 393.5846295428631
Sentence: at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .
Perplexity : 511.4174694904885
Sentence: the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .
Perplexity : 346.8367781407808
Sentence: she was overpowered by shame and vexation .
Perplexity : 612.7183313485082
Sentence: her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world !
Perplexity : 397.0215998652772
Sentence: had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .
Perplexity : 481.2211329447319
Sentence: she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .
Perplexity : 419.1836637685649
Sentence: and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ?
Perplexity : 447.31764241509825
Sentence: that he should even speak to her was amazing !
Perplexity : 403.6842418909418
Sentence: but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !
Perplexity : 338.6540006071969
Sentence: never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .
Perplexity : 555.4867870052814
Sentence: what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing 's park , when he put his letter into her hand !
Perplexity : 631.113185088734
Sentence: they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .
Perplexity : 438.0456740430448
Sentence: her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr. darcy then was .
Perplexity : 402.48733787322055
Sentence: she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .
Perplexity : 242.6286096888919
Sentence: whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .
Perplexity : 266.0370951308098
Sentence: at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .
Perplexity : 359.521672165654
Sentence: mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .
Perplexity : 518.542142220138
Sentence: with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .
Perplexity : 432.1684707353791
Sentence: it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .
Perplexity : 587.232902953067
Sentence: they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it .
Perplexity : 767.1627816899886
Sentence: elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .
Perplexity : 463.48918805946516
Sentence: her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .
Perplexity : 412.6678869848534
Sentence: whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth 's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .
Perplexity : 379.29772062076734
Sentence: the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .
Perplexity : 519.6212852627183
Sentence: elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .
Perplexity : 400.56168166595023
Sentence: for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .
Perplexity : 538.5646931843268
Sentence: this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .
Perplexity : 618.4717115868326
Sentence: with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words `` delightful , '' and `` charming , '' when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .
Perplexity : 368.36780430407333
Sentence: her colour changed , and she said no more .
Perplexity : 263.37271080858324
Sentence: mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .
Perplexity : 309.4329241437087
Sentence: this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .
Perplexity : 434.34646668662964
Sentence: `` what will be his surprise , '' thought she , `` when he knows who they are !
Perplexity : 250.7783024790177
Sentence: the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .
Perplexity : 403.4597431672159
Sentence: that he was surprised by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr. gardiner .
Perplexity : 443.134711780061
Sentence: elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .
Perplexity : 225.31126600933183
Sentence: it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .
Perplexity : 379.46191499846816
Sentence: she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .
Perplexity : 417.56555953073786
Sentence: the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .
Perplexity : 572.963512578641
Sentence: mrs. gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .
Perplexity : 457.2918667790537
Sentence: from what can it proceed ?
Perplexity : 587.4576915237801
Sentence: it can not be for me , it can not be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .
Perplexity : 289.5505222298433
Sentence: my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .
Perplexity : 588.8565691997865
Sentence: it is impossible that he should still love me . ''
Perplexity : 293.2185401587645
Sentence: after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .
Perplexity : 675.8150923383795
Sentence: it originated in mrs. gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth 's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband 's .
Perplexity : 492.2799043358416
Sentence: after a short silence , the lady first spoke .
Perplexity : 373.32860786540783
Sentence: she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected `` for your housekeeper , '' she added , `` informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . ''
Perplexity : 342.299995039454
Sentence: he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .
Perplexity : 437.0972912465435
Sentence: `` they will join me early to morrow , '' he continued , `` and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , mr. bingley and his sisters . ''
Perplexity : 307.63544223758004
Sentence: elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .
Perplexity : 705.1987702155535
Sentence: her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingley 's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .
Perplexity : 524.7802829297865
Sentence: `` there is also one other person in the party , '' he continued after a pause , `` who more particularly wishes to be known to you , will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? ''
Perplexity : 364.176205001827
Sentence: the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .
Perplexity : 296.78640030882264
Sentence: she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .
Perplexity : 326.24453328370834
Sentence: they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought .
Perplexity : 444.2374968195327
Sentence: elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .
Perplexity : 269.41643133285544
Sentence: his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .
Perplexity : 252.0125409899573
Sentence: they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .
Perplexity : 402.47928326644643
Sentence: at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .
Perplexity : 235.20789231745465
Sentence: at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance .
Perplexity : 673.8127128300349
Sentence: yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tte  tte was over .
Perplexity : 1018.881605025888
Sentence: on mr. and mrs. gardiner 's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .
Perplexity : 444.60808254971346
Sentence: mr. darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .
Perplexity : 476.8451437129496
Sentence: the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected .
Perplexity : 412.2982222264625
Sentence: `` he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , '' said her uncle .
Perplexity : 303.6573331077081
Sentence: `` there is something a little stately in him to be sure , '' replied her aunt , `` but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .
Perplexity : 253.4964331641132
Sentence: i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , i have seen nothing of it . ''
Perplexity : 299.82903753909284
Sentence: `` i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .
Perplexity : 279.06509577665565
Sentence: it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention .
Perplexity : 352.84945338981174
Sentence: his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling . ''
Perplexity : 294.8977970089692
Sentence: but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? ''
Perplexity : 329.0964599248589
Sentence: `` but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , '' replied her uncle .
Perplexity : 340.3220918977727
Sentence: `` your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . ''
Perplexity : 473.13251126586226
Sentence: elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .
Perplexity : 350.774770680449
Sentence: `` from what we have seen of him , '' continued mrs. gardiner , `` i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham .
Perplexity : 316.7844444322752
Sentence: he has not an ill natured look .
Perplexity : 535.9241041756912
Sentence: and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .
Perplexity : 376.7479900094822
Sentence: but to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character !
Perplexity : 403.36592904159426
Sentence: i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .
Perplexity : 1261.251043979067
Sentence: but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue . ''
Perplexity : 330.23782808622406
Sentence: elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham 's so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire .
Perplexity : 383.7964929284655
Sentence: in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .

Sentence: the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .

Perplexity : 388.74540204923164
Sentence: it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy 's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .

Perplexity : 303.38371497735034
Sentence: georgiana 's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .

Sentence: by mrs. hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .
Perplexity : 471.1292265004186
Sentence: it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .
Perplexity : 484.15732268578085

Perplexity : 525.2835250893752
Sentence: elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .
Perplexity : 334.62498002616474

Sentence: she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .
Perplexity : 365.5335854569071
Sentence: the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .
Perplexity : 663.2641379351628
Sentence: there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .
Perplexity : 510.56132143150296
Sentence: while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .
Perplexity : 418.73843091667305
Sentence: no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .
Perplexity : 482.18982973501977
Sentence: in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley 's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over .
Perplexity : 508.20333177792463
Sentence: miss darcy , on her brother 's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .

Sentence: they must be a great loss to your family . ''
Perplexity : 260.7795407180481
Sentence: in darcy 's presence she dared not mention wickham 's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment 's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .
Perplexity : 796.402283068241
Sentence: while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .
Perplexity : 614.0582763903677
Sentence: had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy 's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .
Perplexity : 497.8522078170296
Sentence: not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy 's meditated elopement .

Perplexity : 429.10193681744335
Sentence: elizabeth 's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .
Perplexity : 488.0093713295767
Sentence: their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress .
Perplexity : 509.19875111616756
Sentence: but georgiana would not join her .
Perplexity : 355.1291315860213
Sentence: her brother 's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .

Sentence: `` how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy , '' she cried ; `` i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .

Sentence: she is grown so brown and coarse !
Perplexity : 1294.3628914115925

Perplexity : 325.295821934117

Perplexity : 461.5933999960292
Sentence: an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr. gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn .
Perplexity : 329.6546567278024
Sentence: `` i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , '' said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; `` and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .

Sentence: it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel 's family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best .

Sentence: i can not think so very ill of wickham .
Perplexity : 236.30616825992615

Perplexity : 303.76814882099455

Perplexity : 1130.15593493561
Sentence: and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road . ''
Perplexity : 322.6456924867629
Sentence: `` well , then supposing them to be in london .
Perplexity : 232.57916678313364
Sentence: they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .
Perplexity : 389.67100722280594
Sentence: it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland . ''
Perplexity : 478.06075359578693
Sentence: `` but why all this secrecy ?

Perplexity : 587.3504141723095
Sentence: as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .
Perplexity : 479.85001415513256
Sentence: but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good .
Perplexity : 390.0984496648905
Sentence: lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father 's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . ''
Perplexity : 300.02646057569876

Perplexity : 343.281133208281
Sentence: these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .
Perplexity : 431.35250154441684
Sentence: wickham 's affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia 's for him .
Perplexity : 271.0898078805046
Sentence: she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .

Perplexity : 369.8859279747995

Perplexity : 173.48352613792682
Sentence: are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? ''
Perplexity : 470.9702519621403

Sentence: but i must tell you how it went off .
Perplexity : 331.95500125109555

Perplexity : 336.8827719718829
Sentence: i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted .
Perplexity : 419.59483765971964
Sentence: and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .
Perplexity : 344.9116388751783
Sentence: however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham .
Perplexity : 265.8615296573954
Sentence: `` well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them .
Perplexity : 293.1119473350321
Sentence: if you 'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight .
Perplexity : 455.89204069263644

Perplexity : 412.7370635923757
Sentence: and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .
Perplexity : 223.76580471800966
Sentence: well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .
Perplexity : 243.15761491939898
Sentence: but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .
Perplexity : 413.9166195114048
Sentence: however , i recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr. darcy might have done as well . ''
Perplexity : 330.7097175402579
Sentence: `` mr .
Perplexity : 312.47187120039655
Sentence: darcy ! ''

Sentence: i quite forgot !
Perplexity : 1008.3336159139905

Perplexity : 1050.0225534537176
Sentence: what will wickham say ?
Perplexity : 502.2416305776519
Sentence: `` if it was to be secret , '' said jane , `` say not another word on the subject .
Perplexity : 209.7582888361212
Sentence: `` thank you , '' said lydia , `` for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry . ''
Perplexity : 204.86202064045435
Sentence: on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .
Perplexity : 347.4346116261941
Sentence: but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .
Perplexity : 404.18455084934413
Sentence: mr. darcy had been at her sister 's wedding .
Perplexity : 271.88694430204305
Sentence: it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .
Perplexity : 393.55279178402805
Sentence: conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .
Perplexity : 437.8663746127776
Sentence: those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .
Perplexity : 666.5024618047009
Sentence: she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .
Perplexity : 549.0147603145017
Sentence: pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . ''
Perplexity : 490.78548034772984
Sentence: `` not that i shall though , '' she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; `` and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . ''
Perplexity : 289.86059246637
Sentence: jane 's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .
Perplexity : 509.00139931103143
Sentence: elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .
Perplexity : 270.06907896617844
Sentence: `` gracechurch street , sept. 6 .
Perplexity : 1545.8300549375117
Sentence: `` my dear niece , `` i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you .
Perplexity : 397.35224273051375
Sentence: i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from you .
Perplexity : 428.7132427309207
Sentence: do n't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .
Perplexity : 359.3116712066681
Sentence: if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .
Perplexity : 469.62735054903686
Sentence: your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .
Perplexity : 354.0922554527817
Sentence: but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit .
Perplexity : 445.9320862036144
Sentence: mr. darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .
Perplexity : 420.31152336527134
Sentence: he came to tell mr. gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once .
Perplexity : 302.22685300051336
Sentence: from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .
Perplexity : 459.34157700472826
Sentence: the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .
Perplexity : 411.0826477119488
Sentence: his character was to speak for itself .
Perplexity : 335.66965291901073
Sentence: he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .
Perplexity : 372.44772697994944
Sentence: if he had another motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him .
Perplexity : 367.7625319687834
Sentence: he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .
Perplexity : 338.15721038207744
Sentence: there is a lady , it seems , a mrs. younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .
Perplexity : 352.12893282592665
Sentence: she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .
Perplexity : 1027.0860458881577
Sentence: but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .
Perplexity : 398.70976181323675
Sentence: at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction .
Perplexity : 575.3352854341898
Sentence: they were in street .
Perplexity : 263.9586138685252
Sentence: but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .
Perplexity : 605.0702174843569
Sentence: she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham .
Perplexity : 305.82348020166626
Sentence: since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .
Perplexity : 289.6436640434886
Sentence: he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia 's flight , on her own folly alone .
Perplexity : 559.0776947743677
Sentence: he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .
Perplexity : 452.015866757413
Sentence: he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .
Perplexity : 285.97845561526
Sentence: mr. darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .
Perplexity : 395.5017437340147
Sentence: though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .
Perplexity : 318.6411637153031
Sentence: but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .
Perplexity : 425.72387775534395
Sentence: under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .
Perplexity : 468.11976148455324
Sentence: they met several times , for there was much to be discussed .
Perplexity : 416.2992002801344
Sentence: wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .
Perplexity : 487.30318074971746
Sentence: every thing being settled between them , mr. darcy 's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home .
Perplexity : 457.1429911357196
Sentence: but mr. gardiner could not be seen , and mr. darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .
Perplexity : 324.91106297323523
Sentence: he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .
Perplexity : 501.62594204161456
Sentence: he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .
Perplexity : 296.772177774339
Sentence: on saturday he came again .
Perplexity : 481.51393408343006
Sentence: your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together .
Perplexity : 236.9198414734876
Sentence: they met again on sunday , and then i saw him too .
Perplexity : 364.5062041845597
Sentence: it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn .
Perplexity : 333.91347892573623
Sentence: but our visitor was very obstinate .
Perplexity : 744.6187130948977
Sentence: i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .
Perplexity : 377.8701434252966
Sentence: he has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one .
Perplexity : 570.7591823566274
Sentence: nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .
Perplexity : 356.44204256971625
Sentence: they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .
Perplexity : 460.14693325404147
Sentence: but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .
Perplexity : 295.1014010450292
Sentence: you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people .
Perplexity : 303.65268708440004
Sentence: his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .
Perplexity : 448.6053891575356
Sentence: the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .
Perplexity : 280.072851832295
Sentence: it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .
Perplexity : 288.1184487781617
Sentence: but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .
Perplexity : 435.7866021548152
Sentence: when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .
Perplexity : 424.3321891901639
Sentence: i believe i have now told you every thing .
Perplexity : 298.547924760439
Sentence: it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .
Perplexity : 400.14994862870236
Sentence: he was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane 's letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .
Perplexity : 325.87484349795017
Sentence: i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .
Perplexity : 354.895867994502
Sentence: mr. darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding .
Perplexity : 313.50222671962746
Sentence: will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him .
Perplexity : 436.0540846071405
Sentence: his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire .
Perplexity : 297.56969954371135
Sentence: his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .
Perplexity : 476.29005735805003
Sentence: i thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name .
Perplexity : 631.6972198698957
Sentence: pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park .
Perplexity : 521.3777660457201
Sentence: a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .

Sentence: the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .
Perplexity : 668.0854368428928
Sentence: the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sister 's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !
Perplexity : 531.3724667962609
Sentence: he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .
Perplexity : 547.1040675596402
Sentence: her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .
Perplexity : 217.35542998298519
Sentence: but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .
Perplexity : 524.8527001245969
Sentence: brother in law of wickham !
Perplexity : 497.8363137816359

Sentence: she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
Perplexity : 398.34845525065083
Sentence: if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .

Perplexity : 463.7905063779307
Sentence: the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs. bennet 's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .

Sentence: and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ?
Perplexity : 432.2398167962453

Perplexity : 528.092091137498

Sentence: elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .

Perplexity : 284.8832505790808
Sentence: her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr. darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .
Perplexity : 367.84978320417025
Sentence: instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine 's visit .
Perplexity : 423.88133154641423

Perplexity : 328.47374892322995

Perplexity : 561.7028359340484
Sentence: now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , '' mr. darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding your 's .

Sentence: `` i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , '' replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , `` that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .
Perplexity : 307.30384345564715
Sentence: lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars .
Perplexity : 320.4961205118484
Sentence: let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . ''
Perplexity : 395.4192540891054
Sentence: that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny .

Sentence: but your family owe me nothing .
Perplexity : 539.0959867274822

Perplexity : 487.78983475305336
Sentence: elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .
Perplexity : 422.6640357432885
Sentence: had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .
Perplexity : 337.52076893214405
Sentence: they walked on , without knowing in what direction .
Perplexity : 413.4634541338023
Sentence: there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .
Perplexity : 214.50947529148806
Sentence: but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .
Perplexity : 550.1389746933224
Sentence: i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly . ''
Perplexity : 347.01033317542965
Sentence: elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , `` yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .

Sentence: `` what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ?
Perplexity : 228.31643389919736

Sentence: it was unpardonable .
Perplexity : 306.948686776871

Perplexity : 361.7747556558377
Sentence: i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . ''
Perplexity : 771.8973286762229
Sentence: `` the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . ''

Sentence: the adieu is charity itself .
Perplexity : 1341.8469337757758
Sentence: but think no more of the letter .
Perplexity : 180.33591777987127

Perplexity : 489.74331918781326

Sentence: but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley . ''
Perplexity : 570.5996460940258

Perplexity : 416.8211540121951

Sentence: i always had a value for him .
Perplexity : 245.91750334519222
Sentence: were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley 's friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me .
Perplexity : 241.91131345188546
Sentence: but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .
Perplexity : 292.68558200473996
Sentence: how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton !
Perplexity : 519.5977586450916
Sentence: i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you . ''
Perplexity : 122.69434962448224
Sentence: elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .
Perplexity : 316.23861540443295
Sentence: she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .
Perplexity : 407.7577729115763
Sentence: but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia 's marriage .
Perplexity : 359.5345446082657

Perplexity : 409.655287428979
Sentence: what shall we do with him ?
Perplexity : 362.3065434155331
Sentence: lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley 's way . ''
Perplexity : 213.1586007105041
Sentence: elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .
Perplexity : 818.7263307859719
Sentence: as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , `` mr. bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day ? ''
Perplexity : 455.01845800990424
Sentence: `` i advise mr. darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , '' said mrs. bennet , `` to walk to oakham mount this morning .
Perplexity : 260.88028335996233
Sentence: it is a nice long walk , and mr. darcy has never seen the view . ''
Perplexity : 329.21872816663523
Sentence: `` it may do very well for the others , '' replied mr. bingley ; `` but i am sure it will be too much for kitty .

Perplexity : 659.2299378707311
Sentence: so , do not put yourself to inconvenience . ''
Perplexity : 308.43331533673444
Sentence: during their walk , it was resolved that mr. bennet 's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .
Perplexity : 326.4248579744395
Sentence: elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother 's .
Perplexity : 326.965717112984
Sentence: she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .
Perplexity : 546.3284028681214
Sentence: in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
Perplexity : 373.6873681935485
Sentence: in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , `` go to your father , he wants you in the library . ''
Perplexity : 333.1031209484345
Sentence: she was gone directly .
Perplexity : 332.05261554039345

Sentence: are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?
Perplexity : 403.0292913906129
Sentence: have not you always hated him ? ''
Perplexity : 406.70139706152145
Sentence: how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
Perplexity : 762.6063726957882
Sentence: it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 349.9831341562377
Sentence: `` or in other words , you are determined to have him .
Perplexity : 219.82394560743086
Sentence: he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane .
Perplexity : 347.9056979313665
Sentence: but will they make you happy ? ''
Perplexity : 309.31417968157825
Sentence: we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . ''
Perplexity : 323.07863388980786
Sentence: indeed he has no improper pride .
Perplexity : 789.9720697389816
Sentence: he is perfectly amiable .

Sentence: `` lizzy , '' said her father , `` i have given him my consent .
Perplexity : 197.10452594013887
Sentence: he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .
Perplexity : 305.36524736490475
Sentence: i now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .
Perplexity : 218.1700832861047
Sentence: but let me advise you to think better of it .
Perplexity : 292.71072819591103
Sentence: i know your disposition , lizzy .
Perplexity : 258.83880033662143
Sentence: i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .
Perplexity : 548.8197572330212
Sentence: your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .
Perplexity : 830.2004906779756
Sentence: you could scarcely escape discredit and misery .
Perplexity : 1048.068166997831

Perplexity : 481.02752272965
Sentence: you know not what you are about . ''
Perplexity : 195.2423622836401
Sentence: elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
Perplexity : 492.16638268805605
Sentence: `` well , my dear , '' said he , when she ceased speaking , `` i have no more to say .
Perplexity : 172.12860617582314
Sentence: if this be the case , he deserves you .
Perplexity : 239.9649363646112
Sentence: i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy . ''
Perplexity : 241.34497773860042
Sentence: to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr. darcy had voluntarily done for lydia .
Perplexity : 492.80554340651855
Sentence: `` this is an evening of wonders , indeed !
Perplexity : 380.9024875426972

Sentence: so much the better .
Perplexity : 186.1362881186266
Sentence: it will save me a world of trouble and economy .
Perplexity : 522.2296148308185

Perplexity : 535.9677912485392

Sentence: every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .

Sentence: when her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .
Perplexity : 373.32068903313746
Sentence: its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mrs. bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .
Perplexity : 555.8156103552595
Sentence: nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .
