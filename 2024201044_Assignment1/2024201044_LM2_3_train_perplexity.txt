Sentence: `` it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , '' said bingley .
Perplexity : 246181.92000786273

Sentence: lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and mr. collins , in describing the civility of mr. and mrs. philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house .
Perplexity : 246066.7612978607
Sentence: elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr. wickham and herself .
Perplexity : 119196.33332375923
Sentence: jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr. bingley 's regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham .
Perplexity : 178880.7596067962
Sentence: the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .
Perplexity : 301016.19422702695
Sentence: `` they have both , '' said she , `` been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .

Perplexity : 294574.36307235924
Sentence: `` laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .
Perplexity : 151048.2858260139
Sentence: my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr. darcy , to be treating his father 's favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for .
Perplexity : 247387.24222360973
Sentence: it is impossible .
Perplexity : 169154.17367318503
Sentence: no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .
Perplexity : 302355.2850543567
Sentence: no . ''
Perplexity : 127139.27865290611
Sentence: `` i can much more easily believe mr. bingley 's being imposed on , than that mr. wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony .
Perplexity : 344614.1084519522
Sentence: besides , there was truth in his looks . ''
Perplexity : 383113.16343211697
Sentence: `` it is difficult indeed it is distressing .
Perplexity : 324468.67818390595
Sentence: one does not know what to think . ''
Perplexity : 49888.53684654792
Sentence: `` i beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . ''
Perplexity : 156593.69051775444
Sentence: but jane could think with certainty on only one point , that mr. bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .
Perplexity : 215248.91214763772
Sentence: the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday .
Perplexity : 267394.25236216414
Sentence: the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .
Perplexity : 372965.34733499016
Sentence: to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding mrs. bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .
Perplexity : 128397.23335804442
Sentence: they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennet 's civilities .
Perplexity : 489967.82455819513
Sentence: the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .
Perplexity : 235564.00915397803
Sentence: jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr. wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr. darcy 's looks and behaviour .
Perplexity : 186567.7260653997
Sentence: the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .
Perplexity : 270804.8018626382
Sentence: and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .
Perplexity : 265150.04289410805
Sentence: `` while i can have my mornings to myself , '' said she , `` it is enough .
Perplexity : 136193.47070078284
Sentence: i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .
Perplexity : 395100.22088263923
Sentence: society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body . ''
Perplexity : 316339.17275995854
Sentence: elizabeth 's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley 's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening 's amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance .
Perplexity : 169731.6641454303
Sentence: elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .
Perplexity : 467684.41098396695
Sentence: she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances : and to have mr. collins instead !
Perplexity : 540512.1570571297
Sentence: her liveliness had been never worse timed .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: there was no help for it however .
Perplexity : 334807.891757227
Sentence: mr. wickham 's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr. collins 's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .
Perplexity : 226502.2880949361
Sentence: the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .
Perplexity : 323068.8848654463
Sentence: elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .
Perplexity : 391440.4749457667
Sentence: mr. collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .
Perplexity : 280570.36303496215
Sentence: no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy .
Perplexity : 647695.9506133987
Sentence: till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .
Perplexity : 347401.01666438667
Sentence: the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .
Perplexity : 388413.9320787865
Sentence: she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .
Perplexity : 247741.86822689918
Sentence: but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcy 's pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr. denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , '' i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . ''
Perplexity : 234602.10789807848
Sentence: this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .
Perplexity : 403021.564860126
Sentence: attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .
Perplexity : 521456.64680140687
Sentence: she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .
Perplexity : 209534.70882902367
Sentence: the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .
Perplexity : 454433.8818120276
Sentence: mr. collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .
Perplexity : 374678.45855851175
Sentence: the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .
Perplexity : 226232.02543228026
Sentence: when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .
Perplexity : 183601.10657027178
Sentence: he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her .
Perplexity : 278550.2443735907
Sentence: `` i dare say you will find him very agreeable . ''
Perplexity : 138724.54180020653
Sentence: `` heaven forbid !
Perplexity : 286962.70828697627
Sentence: that would be the greatest misfortune of all !
Perplexity : 293831.4431877903
Sentence: to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !
Perplexity : 467684.41098396695
Sentence: do not wish me such an evil . ''
Perplexity : 322353.2059310245
Sentence: when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .
Perplexity : 250153.33869771575
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .
Perplexity : 273454.3644897481
Sentence: they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .
Perplexity : 269757.63581126713
Sentence: he replied , and was again silent .
Perplexity : 135934.047597636
Sentence: after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with '' it is your turn to say something now , mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 277587.41748095455
Sentence: i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . ''
Perplexity : 232083.54734538778
Sentence: he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .
Perplexity : 244766.84633443976
Sentence: `` very well .
Perplexity : 35048.4550269869
Sentence: that reply will do for the present .
Perplexity : 252964.89090899893
Sentence: perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: but now we may be silent . ''
Perplexity : 493767.6223888879
Sentence: `` sometimes .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: one must speak a little , you know .
Perplexity : 157450.84862462638
Sentence: it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . ''
Perplexity : 215312.62544959164
Sentence: `` are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? ''
Perplexity : 416818.52946915093
Sentence: `` both , '' replied elizabeth archly ; `` for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .
Perplexity : 214575.71346637805
Sentence: we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . ''
Perplexity : 412835.5128663525
Sentence: `` this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , '' said he .
Perplexity : 105509.90021182776
Sentence: you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly . ''
Perplexity : 406766.3856209931
Sentence: he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton .
Perplexity : 192904.886001004
Sentence: she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , `` when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . ''
Perplexity : 241568.55126451608
Sentence: the effect was immediate .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .
Perplexity : 202771.13766681202
Sentence: at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , '' mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . ''
Perplexity : 401189.4966333466
Sentence: `` he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , '' replied elizabeth with emphasis , `` and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . ''
Perplexity : 206498.95924338157
Sentence: at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr. darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .
Perplexity : 282360.75996662397
Sentence: `` i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir .
Perplexity : 104662.4391694339
Sentence: such very superior dancing is not often seen .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: it is evident that you belong to the first circles .
Perplexity : 451065.6453075962
Sentence: allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley , ) shall take place .
Perplexity : 200723.70139108156
Sentence: what congratulations will then flow in !
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999
Sentence: i appeal to mr. darcy : but let me not interrupt you , sir .
Perplexity : 244345.0935244978
Sentence: you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . ''
Perplexity : 392049.01057775575
Sentence: we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i can not imagine . ''
Perplexity : 245439.95811141442
Sentence: `` what think you of books ? ''
Perplexity : 286962.7082869758
Sentence: `` books oh !
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . ''
Perplexity : 234133.99825579856
Sentence: we may compare our different opinions . ''
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: `` no i can not talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of something else . ''
Perplexity : 302391.7218501607
Sentence: `` the present always occupies you in such scenes does it ? ''
Perplexity : 446703.74260757334
Sentence: said he , with a look of doubt .
Perplexity : 55213.05724642082
Sentence: `` yes , always , '' she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , `` i remember hearing you once say , mr. darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .
Perplexity : 188122.27063705202
Sentence: `` i am , '' said he , with a firm voice .
Perplexity : 80174.2988679592
Sentence: `` and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? ''
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999
Sentence: `` i hope not . ''
Perplexity : 83314.32991145186
Sentence: `` it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . ''
Perplexity : 362073.10118335584
Sentence: `` may i ask to what these questions tend ? ''
Perplexity : 480613.5022971806
Sentence: `` merely to the illustration of your character , '' said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .
Perplexity : 335970.17859901016
Sentence: `` i am trying to make it out . ''
Perplexity : 94100.98205101858
Sentence: she shook her head .
Perplexity : 92662.2794962322
Sentence: i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . ''
Perplexity : 481735.99982365436
Sentence: `` i can readily believe , '' answered he gravely , `` that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . ''
Perplexity : 224278.9957078637
Sentence: `` but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity . ''
Perplexity : 226995.5964685839
Sentence: `` i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , '' he coldly replied .
Perplexity : 251358.34880710943
Sentence: she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy 's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .
Perplexity : 300123.5804559073
Sentence: they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , '' so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !
Perplexity : 230927.98310595754
Sentence: your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr. darcy 's steward .
Perplexity : 199480.11889573425
Sentence: let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr. darcy 's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner .
Perplexity : 235918.15279857678
Sentence: i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ''
Perplexity : 368745.12181970204
Sentence: `` his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , '' said elizabeth angrily ; `` for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcy 's steward , and of that , i can assure you , he informed me himself . ''
Perplexity : 188796.88733349546
Sentence: `` i beg your pardon , '' replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .
Perplexity : 143685.89783433935
Sentence: `` excuse my interference .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: it was kindly meant . ''
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: said elizabeth to herself .
Perplexity : 214546.76155183226
Sentence: i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr .
Perplexity : 546253.0123704573
Sentence: she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley .
Perplexity : 306317.0244191918
Sentence: jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .
Perplexity : 248309.74578250406
Sentence: elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane 's being in the fairest way for happiness .
Perplexity : 256806.1947198279
Sentence: `` i want to know , '' said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister 's , `` what you have learnt about mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 143237.01775600048
Sentence: but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ''
Perplexity : 288924.9465660575
Sentence: mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister 's , mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
Perplexity : 207035.58536425245
Sentence: i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr. darcy 's regard . ''
Perplexity : 158268.07690718677
Sentence: `` mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself ? ''
Perplexity : 239449.6210938412
Sentence: `` this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 210324.9590527036
Sentence: i am perfectly satisfied .
Perplexity : 124688.04546407505
Sentence: `` he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only . ''
Perplexity : 273931.41354166105
Sentence: `` i have not a doubt of mr. bingley 's sincerity , '' said elizabeth warmly ; '' but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
Perplexity : 181845.1401071813
Sentence: mr. bingley 's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before . ''
Perplexity : 264735.8106115176
Sentence: elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley 's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .
Perplexity : 297599.7908279336
Sentence: on their being joined by mr. bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr. collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
Perplexity : 358391.54067697324
Sentence: `` i have found out , '' said he , `` by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .
Perplexity : 162384.0796473334
Sentence: i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine .
Perplexity : 218813.7822240714
Sentence: how wonderfully these sort of things occur !

Sentence: it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night . ''
Perplexity : 269787.54392377404
Sentence: elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr. darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .
Perplexity : 238249.85100936223
Sentence: mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , '' my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .
Perplexity : 325113.7679904268

Perplexity : 346365.61258076335
Sentence: her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words `` apology , '' '' hunsford , '' and `` lady catherine de bourgh . ''

Perplexity : 220350.36285240453
Sentence: mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr. collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .
Perplexity : 260093.49715035845
Sentence: mr. collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr. darcy 's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .
Perplexity : 161235.44460343482
Sentence: mr. collins then returned to elizabeth .
Perplexity : 378560.93560011516

Perplexity : 376421.1659632553
Sentence: as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .

Sentence: her mother 's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .
Perplexity : 285337.7644900509
Sentence: when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr. bingley .
Perplexity : 292149.1954062056
Sentence: it was an animating subject , and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .
Perplexity : 235178.9665779729
Sentence: his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .
Perplexity : 208497.50476107624
Sentence: it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .

Sentence: she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .
Perplexity : 373377.70051307103
Sentence: in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother 's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy , who sat opposite to them .
Perplexity : 254808.36128827257
Sentence: her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .

Sentence: elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .
Perplexity : 377757.1002726782
Sentence: she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr. darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .
Perplexity : 193227.5249406852
Sentence: the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .
Perplexity : 552491.5846708408

Sentence: elizabeth now began to revive .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .
Perplexity : 353228.09880305245
Sentence: by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .
Perplexity : 289360.29836332245
Sentence: mary 's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected .

Sentence: elizabeth was in agonies .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401

Sentence: let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . ''
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father 's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .
Perplexity : 295059.2271819094
Sentence: others of the party were now applied to .
Perplexity : 282360.60897181707
Sentence: `` if i , '' said mr. collins , `` were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .
Perplexity : 182343.92952854448
Sentence: i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .
Perplexity : 393665.8366987607
Sentence: the rector of a parish has much to do .
Perplexity : 284875.345745127

Perplexity : 282457.26762349607
Sentence: he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible .
Perplexity : 257696.30747319397
Sentence: and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .
Perplexity : 238474.56143750486
Sentence: i can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . ''
Perplexity : 282760.7134855586
Sentence: and with a bow to mr. darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .
Perplexity : 182028.3163714115
Sentence: many stared .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .
Perplexity : 317648.295824616
Sentence: to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .
Perplexity : 278000.8375846707
Sentence: that his two sisters and mr. darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .

Sentence: the rest of the evening brought her little amusement .
Perplexity : 130700.1015843278
Sentence: she was teazed by mr. collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .
Perplexity : 152453.72838868565
Sentence: in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .
Perplexity : 299335.95799902116
Sentence: he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .
Perplexity : 223236.49463300363
Sentence: there was no arguing upon such a project .
Perplexity : 367904.45155451994

Perplexity : 219349.58447440207

Sentence: she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham , and rejoiced in it .
Perplexity : 138590.95673221047
Sentence: the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .
Perplexity : 267592.5577381651
Sentence: mrs. hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .
Perplexity : 261555.45869269647
Sentence: they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins , who was complimenting mr. bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .
Perplexity : 237221.61276282815
Sentence: darcy said nothing at all .
Perplexity : 98945.50122067171
Sentence: mr. bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .
Perplexity : 215082.23521638525
Sentence: elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of `` lord , how tired i am ! ''

Sentence: accompanied by a violent yawn .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401

Perplexity : 284556.75087124866
Sentence: mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months .

Sentence: of having another daughter married to mr. collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .
Perplexity : 202971.70251108592
Sentence: elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield .
Perplexity : 254712.57216977738
Sentence: the next day opened a new scene at longbourn .
Perplexity : 258090.8055417269
Sentence: mr. collins made his declaration in form .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401

Perplexity : 318165.5545776707
Sentence: on finding mrs. bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , '' may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ?

Perplexity : 335481.3424894422

Sentence: almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life .
Perplexity : 292527.007318034
Sentence: but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did . ''
Perplexity : 259706.8420704794
Sentence: the idea of mr. collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : '' my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .
Perplexity : 323237.5816060242
Sentence: secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness .

Perplexity : 152111.79551491694
Sentence: you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .
Perplexity : 434633.9629259387
Sentence: thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women .
Perplexity : 426262.4570999371
Sentence: but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years .

Perplexity : 230204.0246595916

Sentence: and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr. collins thus addressed her , '' when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . ''
Perplexity : 316280.0512898794

Perplexity : 414023.53762432677
Sentence: my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .
Perplexity : 269813.27339233627

Sentence: to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .
Perplexity : 403736.1125906016
Sentence: mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs. bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .

Sentence: `` but depend upon it , mr. collins , '' she added , `` that lizzy shall be brought to reason .
Perplexity : 53723.62602495225
Sentence: i will speak to her about it myself directly .
Perplexity : 431120.15046217554

Perplexity : 167674.66401547327
Sentence: if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . ''

Perplexity : 243653.83903941148

Sentence: elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr. collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .

Perplexity : 182520.8442635245
Sentence: perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .

Sentence: my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own .

Perplexity : 373806.1705135281
Sentence: the discussion of mr. collins 's offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .
Perplexity : 201861.1950350431
Sentence: as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .
Perplexity : 492138.1326753805
Sentence: he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .
Perplexity : 156589.31443581448

Perplexity : 183318.53296567374
Sentence: she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .
Perplexity : 284544.7257278804
Sentence: his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .
Perplexity : 245764.27284679204
Sentence: soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately .

Sentence: the next was in these words .
Perplexity : 337702.75708883663
Sentence: `` i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .
Perplexity : 325067.1310442851
Sentence: i depend on you for that . ''
Perplexity : 376421.16596325394
Sentence: to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley 's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .
Perplexity : 205673.00304266013

Sentence: i will read it to you '' when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .
Perplexity : 277164.21735788556
Sentence: i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you . ''

Perplexity : 134052.5137256356
Sentence: i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .

Sentence: i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .
Perplexity : 150374.97164592886
Sentence: my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister 's partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman 's heart .
Perplexity : 287116.9847257738
Sentence: with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? ''

Sentence: `` is it not clear enough ?
Perplexity : 467684.41098396695

Sentence: to put me on my guard ?

Sentence: `` you shall have it in few words .
Perplexity : 513284.46383303514
Sentence: miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy .
Perplexity : 167839.71304234394
Sentence: she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . ''

Sentence: but the case is this .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way .
Perplexity : 264522.92823357607
Sentence: but , my dearest jane , you can not seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ''
Perplexity : 156657.67949922968
Sentence: `` if we thought alike of miss bingley , '' replied jane , `` your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .

Sentence: you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .
Perplexity : 201363.1786676241
Sentence: `` but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? ''
Perplexity : 278763.807181641

Sentence: elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr. collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .

Perplexity : 235878.97780379484
Sentence: jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .

Perplexity : 273760.4418720893
Sentence: on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .

Perplexity : 361076.6214747068
Sentence: but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .

Perplexity : 109019.39135022313

Sentence: elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr. darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley 's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself .
Perplexity : 261021.315423691
Sentence: charlotte had seen them from her husband 's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , '' i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility .

Sentence: his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , '' what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ?

Perplexity : 337702.757088836
Sentence: `` perhaps , '' said darcy , `` i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . ''

Perplexity : 273349.0120171454

Sentence: `` i can answer your question , '' said fitzwilliam , `` without applying to him .

Perplexity : 268807.7185692123
Sentence: i can not catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done . ''
Perplexity : 301343.48819727247
Sentence: `` my fingers , '' said elizabeth , `` do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women 's do .
Perplexity : 312097.7278361084
Sentence: they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .
Perplexity : 417948.21973960614
Sentence: but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising .
Perplexity : 242795.0595512512
Sentence: it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman 's of superior execution . ''
Perplexity : 249967.46872375754
Sentence: darcy smiled and said , `` you are perfectly right .
Perplexity : 120748.94110748741
Sentence: we neither of us perform to strangers . ''
Perplexity : 365092.9488337461
Sentence: here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .
Perplexity : 229975.04736553802
Sentence: elizabeth immediately began playing again .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy , '' miss bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master .
Perplexity : 178500.23108620945
Sentence: she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne 's .
Perplexity : 382456.60643506417
Sentence: anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . ''
Perplexity : 309505.30194051244
Sentence: elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin 's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .
Perplexity : 203448.63449525903
Sentence: lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth 's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .
Perplexity : 591681.9545864294
Sentence: elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship 's carriage was ready to take them all home .
Perplexity : 267750.7351549623
Sentence: as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr. darcy , and mr. darcy only , entered the room .
Perplexity : 179703.00649311324
Sentence: he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .
Perplexity : 425520.53648213757
Sentence: they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .
Perplexity : 357493.8983125573
Sentence: it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , '' how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 219490.4761981292
Sentence: it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before .
Perplexity : 226627.6791955961
Sentence: he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london . ''
Perplexity : 139051.99415234604
Sentence: she found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , '' i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ? ''
Perplexity : 158465.51479568717
Sentence: `` i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .
Perplexity : 204611.77148925973
Sentence: he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . ''
Perplexity : 349975.43592317955
Sentence: `` if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .
Perplexity : 276430.08852500183
Sentence: but perhaps mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . ''
Perplexity : 295520.15542034956
Sentence: `` i should not be surprised , '' said darcy , `` if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . ''
Perplexity : 115623.00191985189
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer .
Perplexity : 24052.25510105983
Sentence: she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .
Perplexity : 174098.23287420353
Sentence: he took the hint , and soon began with , `` this seems a very comfortable house .
Perplexity : 253255.61413056936
Sentence: lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr. collins first came to hunsford . ''
Perplexity : 165196.14745727443
Sentence: `` mr. collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . ''
Perplexity : 308579.5508191249
Sentence: `` yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .
Perplexity : 316396.3273786389
Sentence: my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did .
Perplexity : 401314.0795655103
Sentence: she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . ''
Perplexity : 142014.17011895755
Sentence: `` an easy distance do you call it ?
Perplexity : 406766.38562099164
Sentence: it is nearly fifty miles . ''
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999
Sentence: yes , i call it a very easy distance . ''
Perplexity : 414695.7733848689
Sentence: `` i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , '' cried elizabeth .
Perplexity : 82402.52945033535
Sentence: `` i should never have said mrs. collins was settled near her family . ''
Perplexity : 182749.43810526942
Sentence: `` it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire .
Perplexity : 134077.4787747043
Sentence: any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far . ''
Perplexity : 278025.26784747886
Sentence: as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , '' i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .
Perplexity : 193412.5950522724
Sentence: the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .
Perplexity : 444679.1930676801
Sentence: but that is not the case here .
Perplexity : 177840.94323919687
Sentence: mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , `` you can not have a right to such very strong local attachment .
Perplexity : 155939.14546993593
Sentence: you can not have been always at longbourn . ''
Perplexity : 97744.49869135948
Sentence: the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , '' are you pleased with kent ? ''
Perplexity : 349012.4921801796
Sentence: a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .
Perplexity : 218771.4490866734
Sentence: the tte  tte surprised them .
Perplexity : 273349.0120171459
Sentence: mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .
Perplexity : 202157.50445669115
Sentence: said charlotte , as soon as he was gone .
Perplexity : 41323.65154374385
Sentence: `` my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . ''
Perplexity : 133430.24882364698
Sentence: but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte 's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .
Perplexity : 300348.3211467972
Sentence: all field sports were over .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen can not be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .
Perplexity : 249157.4211002444
Sentence: they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .
Perplexity : 339619.42576722335
Sentence: it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam 's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .
Perplexity : 238622.71330146914
Sentence: but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .
Perplexity : 305092.22127196606
Sentence: it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .
Perplexity : 301623.7336933568
Sentence: he seldom appeared really animated .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: mrs. collins knew not what to make of him .
Perplexity : 137946.4964298876
Sentence: she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success .
Perplexity : 293060.0401601835
Sentence: he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .
Perplexity : 218955.68721533
Sentence: it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .
Perplexity : 298599.45933703764
Sentence: she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend 's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .
Perplexity : 232868.86208934427
Sentence: in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .
Perplexity : 475676.4288860596
Sentence: he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .
Perplexity : 237938.3152567957
Sentence: more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 331517.74069817737
Sentence: she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .
Perplexity : 287994.1064078095
Sentence: how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !
Perplexity : 420769.5903789625
Sentence: yet it did , and even a third .
Perplexity : 243209.13650883024
Sentence: it seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .
Perplexity : 393316.6183960746
Sentence: he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collins 's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too .
Perplexity : 271534.26262943965
Sentence: his words seemed to imply it .
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999
Sentence: could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .
Perplexity : 324351.1664167915
Sentence: it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage .
Perplexity : 181816.2841790465
Sentence: she was engaged one day as she walked , in re perusing jane 's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .
Perplexity : 272862.24021303206
Sentence: putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , '' i did not know before that you ever walked this way . ''
Perplexity : 173565.80668877056
Sentence: `` i have been making the tour of the park , '' he replied , `` as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage .
Perplexity : 159376.62741331934
Sentence: are you going much farther ? ''
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999
Sentence: `` no , i should have turned in a moment . ''
Perplexity : 55805.015273556295
Sentence: and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .
Perplexity : 261830.9380015362
Sentence: `` do you certainly leave kent on saturday ? ''
Perplexity : 436986.1998216923
Sentence: `` yes if darcy does not put it off again .
Perplexity : 451065.6453075962
Sentence: but i am at his disposal .
Perplexity : 150344.0687564409
Sentence: he arranges the business just as he pleases . ''

Perplexity : 367079.0338588123
Sentence: when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr. darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend 's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister .
Perplexity : 226490.4685953945
Sentence: the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .

Sentence: they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .
Perplexity : 471644.09054294124
Sentence: but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .
Perplexity : 299632.28006573714
Sentence: elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .
Perplexity : 413311.8055752595
Sentence: it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .
Perplexity : 287128.2334239901
Sentence: she could not think of darcy 's leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .

Perplexity : 213030.56832947404

Perplexity : 209340.3342612878
Sentence: this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .
Perplexity : 264856.68524782965
Sentence: he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .
Perplexity : 219244.51791118414
Sentence: his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .
Perplexity : 480811.1651776947
Sentence: in spite of her deeply rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man 's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .
Perplexity : 243550.93516359432
Sentence: she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .
Perplexity : 223671.14325429435
Sentence: he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .
Perplexity : 235269.08212661196
Sentence: he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .
Perplexity : 387618.4304227139
Sentence: such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , '' in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .
Perplexity : 230214.1415424757
Sentence: it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you .
Perplexity : 294025.5367314931
Sentence: but i can not i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .
Perplexity : 197401.81491121982
Sentence: i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .
Perplexity : 163155.75452842726
Sentence: it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration .
Perplexity : 144396.8222335801
Sentence: the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . ''
Perplexity : 454807.1772350063
Sentence: mr. darcy , who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .
Perplexity : 281280.98479219386
Sentence: his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .
Perplexity : 372031.4138124211
Sentence: the pause was to elizabeth 's feelings dreadful .
Perplexity : 327370.7545135956
Sentence: at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , '' and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !
Perplexity : 139885.4906162103
Sentence: but it is of small importance . ''
Perplexity : 229921.15505269528
Sentence: `` i might as well enquire , '' replied she , `` why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?
Perplexity : 374982.0619060378
Sentence: but i have other provocations .
Perplexity : 294824.9694223929
Sentence: you know i have .
Perplexity : 376421.1659632553
Sentence: had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? ''
Perplexity : 272926.5913596398
Sentence: as she pronounced these words , mr. darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .
Perplexity : 337918.7518448134
Sentence: `` i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .
Perplexity : 122245.901695255
Sentence: no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: you dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . ''
Perplexity : 308740.0283795686
Sentence: she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .
Perplexity : 408663.46476954874
Sentence: `` can you deny that you have done it ? ''
Perplexity : 147308.54087141433
Sentence: towards him i have been kinder than towards myself . ''
Perplexity : 278502.4686074444
Sentence: elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .
Perplexity : 433385.70509093057
Sentence: `` but it is not merely this affair , '' she continued , `` on which my dislike is founded .
Perplexity : 156318.52271801385
Sentence: long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .
Perplexity : 311548.89562016854
Sentence: your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 519279.6915936339
Sentence: on this subject , what can you have to say ?
Perplexity : 129508.91404808524
Sentence: in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?
Perplexity : 550379.2321293823
Sentence: or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? ''
Perplexity : 481735.99982365436
Sentence: `` you take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns , '' said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .

Sentence: `` who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? ''
Perplexity : 403798.9470540989
Sentence: `` his misfortunes ! ''
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: repeated darcy contemptuously ; `` yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . ''
Perplexity : 342977.9284374423
Sentence: `` and of your infliction , '' cried elizabeth with energy .
Perplexity : 189642.54976528315
Sentence: `` you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .
Perplexity : 497608.26237926004
Sentence: you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .
Perplexity : 180851.3265540396
Sentence: you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .
Perplexity : 535034.6839718377
Sentence: you have done all this !
Perplexity : 286962.70828697627
Sentence: and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . ''
Perplexity : 475955.4438502903
Sentence: `` and this , '' cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , '' is your opinion of me !
Perplexity : 122254.18330806518
Sentence: this is the estimation in which you hold me !
Perplexity : 463019.26995546906
Sentence: i thank you for explaining it so fully .
Perplexity : 460698.1921705781
Sentence: my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !
Perplexity : 472768.37118508894
Sentence: but perhaps , '' added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , `` these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .
Perplexity : 365727.0436328107
Sentence: these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing .
Perplexity : 426377.58460258105
Sentence: but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .
Perplexity : 528426.6984948734
Sentence: they were natural and just .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?
Perplexity : 387843.1521359111
Sentence: to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? ''
Perplexity : 455627.1768087567
Sentence: elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , '' you are mistaken , mr. darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ''
Perplexity : 239636.31815184603
Sentence: she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , '' you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ''
Perplexity : 183544.15731532197
Sentence: again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .
Perplexity : 210078.10594357448
Sentence: she went on .
Perplexity : 286962.70828697627
Sentence: `` from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry . ''
Perplexity : 296330.51167055115
Sentence: `` you have said quite enough , madam .
Perplexity : 396971.0021698225
Sentence: i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .
Perplexity : 360926.6616659496
Sentence: forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . ''
Perplexity : 434377.1206359451
Sentence: and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .
Perplexity : 278522.79966621386
Sentence: she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .
Perplexity : 151667.97350520565
Sentence: her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .
Perplexity : 184999.59868063693
Sentence: that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 103045.42621921939
Sentence: that he should have been in love with her for so many months !
Perplexity : 86109.72250919284
Sentence: so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend 's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !
Perplexity : 196415.43567885988
Sentence: it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .
Perplexity : 550379.2321293823
Sentence: she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine 's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte 's observation , and hurried her away to her room .
Perplexity : 330146.178354697
Sentence: elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .
Perplexity : 315954.70259772416
Sentence: she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .
Perplexity : 230387.52858199316

Perplexity : 364998.843869842
Sentence: i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .
Perplexity : 225833.3806699833
Sentence: you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice .

Perplexity : 240200.68342777612
Sentence: wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .
Perplexity : 318435.4344603217
Sentence: but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .
Perplexity : 385307.44773374184
Sentence: if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your 's , i can only say that i am sorry .
Perplexity : 222290.3375541968

Sentence: at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas 's accidental information , that bingley 's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .

Sentence: your sister i also watched .
Perplexity : 356821.0794214564
Sentence: her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening 's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .
Perplexity : 342718.4626797938
Sentence: if you have not been mistaken here , i must have been in an error .
Perplexity : 157703.32507080564
Sentence: your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .
Perplexity : 433604.4856120996
Sentence: if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .
Perplexity : 252849.70218728902

Perplexity : 396966.34194241423
Sentence: i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ; i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason .
Perplexity : 350158.2766513015
Sentence: my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .
Perplexity : 364826.6516187848
Sentence: but there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .
Perplexity : 363027.34278930916
Sentence: these causes must be stated , though briefly .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: pardon me .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: it pains me to offend you .
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999
Sentence: but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .
Perplexity : 418727.74505059735
Sentence: i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .
Perplexity : 430574.6281424823
Sentence: he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .
Perplexity : 193020.31982218724

Sentence: we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .
Perplexity : 416456.6451999598
Sentence: i described , and enforced them earnestly .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister 's indifference .
Perplexity : 361642.0882675255
Sentence: he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .
Perplexity : 429549.30784336233
Sentence: to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .
Perplexity : 177823.54345767465
Sentence: to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .
Perplexity : 312429.35308575287
Sentence: i can not blame myself for having done thus much .
Perplexity : 352700.4013617368
Sentence: there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town .
Perplexity : 248530.2641524501
Sentence: i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .
Perplexity : 185419.94678318116
Sentence: that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .
Perplexity : 310954.53540973744
Sentence: perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .
Perplexity : 148201.87332765784
Sentence: if i have wounded your sister 's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them .
Perplexity : 229720.05973181818
Sentence: with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr. wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .
Perplexity : 323172.6673285395
Sentence: of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .
Perplexity : 330766.5775304232
Sentence: my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education .
Perplexity : 281711.2606904896
Sentence: my father was not only fond of this young man 's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .
Perplexity : 291465.00582700956
Sentence: as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner .
Perplexity : 225463.19959448953
Sentence: here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell .
Perplexity : 475676.4288860596
Sentence: it adds even another motive .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .
Perplexity : 321648.80437477626
Sentence: there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .
Perplexity : 251443.13123075257
Sentence: his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr. wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .
Perplexity : 414605.64605271723
Sentence: i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .
Perplexity : 310393.0980830007
Sentence: the business was therefore soon settled .
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999
Sentence: i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town .
Perplexity : 211869.88176412205
Sentence: in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .
Perplexity : 579613.2254348111
Sentence: for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .
Perplexity : 269013.8018999617
Sentence: you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .
Perplexity : 404597.2429645591
Sentence: his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .
Perplexity : 456853.78169584164
Sentence: after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .
Perplexity : 540512.1570571297
Sentence: how he lived i know not .
Perplexity : 333781.03027441265
Sentence: but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .
Perplexity : 420369.89058696
Sentence: having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy .
Perplexity : 264623.0422571789
Sentence: my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .
Perplexity : 232146.8901041143
Sentence: about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .
Perplexity : 343515.0859900939
Sentence: i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .
Perplexity : 355696.99395228835
Sentence: you may imagine what i felt and how i acted .
Perplexity : 451065.645307597
Sentence: regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge .
Perplexity : 272247.4582189712
Sentence: mr. wickham 's chief object was unquestionably my sister 's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .
Perplexity : 213061.70201008685
Sentence: his revenge would have been complete indeed .
Perplexity : 291453.30216812645
Sentence: this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 211197.37979231236
Sentence: i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .
Perplexity : 412564.76537861925
Sentence: you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .
Perplexity : 303844.72323918645
Sentence: but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .
Perplexity : 247364.05235012915
Sentence: for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .
Perplexity : 310149.45632183587
Sentence: if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .
Perplexity : 254692.51042996318
Sentence: i will only add , god bless you .
Perplexity : 513284.46383303514
Sentence: `` fitzwilliam darcy . ''
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: if elizabeth , when mr. darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .
Perplexity : 230827.91173837543
Sentence: her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .
Perplexity : 451065.6453075962
Sentence: with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .
Perplexity : 373637.2880135893
Sentence: she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .
Perplexity : 382906.3713436927
Sentence: his belief of her sister 's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .
Perplexity : 310644.55203229055
Sentence: he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .
Perplexity : 429920.9124545892
Sentence: it was all pride and insolence .
Perplexity : 378560.93560011516
Sentence: but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .
Perplexity : 375404.6731816444
Sentence: astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .
Perplexity : 434152.9094662719
Sentence: she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , `` this must be false !
Perplexity : 318108.9578887889
Sentence: this can not be !
Perplexity : 42950.074040750995
Sentence: this must be the grossest falsehood ! ''
Perplexity : 331824.785708766
Sentence: and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .
Perplexity : 208530.0905924513
Sentence: in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .
Perplexity : 264848.7027233805
Sentence: the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .
Perplexity : 205665.55692831578
Sentence: so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .
Perplexity : 320011.66149127367
Sentence: what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .
Perplexity : 234542.7172938012
Sentence: but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham 's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .
Perplexity : 461409.53205355065
Sentence: on both sides it was only assertion .
Perplexity : 278223.98993825034
Sentence: again she read on .
Perplexity : 292511.9476980122
Sentence: but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr. darcy 's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .
Perplexity : 355088.82994368393
Sentence: she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .
Perplexity : 221737.80769197262
Sentence: as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .
Perplexity : 170067.54330502712
Sentence: his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .
Perplexity : 451065.645307597
Sentence: she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .
Perplexity : 396593.36876027606
Sentence: but no such recollection befriended her .
Perplexity : 467684.41098396695
Sentence: after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .
Perplexity : 534654.0117402025
Sentence: the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin 's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .
Perplexity : 341512.3871703562
Sentence: at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin 's corroboration .
Perplexity : 188602.29074611742
Sentence: she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr. philips 's .
Perplexity : 411969.5268651094
Sentence: she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .
Perplexity : 354776.6744873402
Sentence: she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr. darcy that mr. darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week .
Perplexity : 242531.9234770186
Sentence: she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr. darcy 's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .
Perplexity : 344343.802898921
Sentence: how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !
Perplexity : 320026.5715296702
Sentence: his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .
Perplexity : 363592.9588259506
Sentence: his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn .
Perplexity : 403358.0385182355
Sentence: every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of mr. darcy , she could not but allow that mr. bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .
Perplexity : 245152.12266334717
Sentence: that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling .
Perplexity : 349649.46572696295
Sentence: that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr. bingley , was incomprehensible .
Perplexity : 274711.13468611694
Sentence: she grew absolutely ashamed of herself .
Perplexity : 467684.41098396695
Sentence: of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .
Perplexity : 383960.0479409354
Sentence: `` how despicably have i acted ! ''
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: she cried .
Perplexity : 27806.319148936163
Sentence: `` i , who have prided myself on my discernment !
Perplexity : 334706.80085603823
Sentence: i , who have valued myself on my abilities !
Perplexity : 308195.4382160968
Sentence: how humiliating is this discovery !
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: yet , how just a humiliation !
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999
Sentence: had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind .
Perplexity : 107730.02997009236

Sentence: `` poor wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !

Sentence: how i wanted you ! ''
Perplexity : 431120.15046217554
Sentence: `` how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved . ''
Perplexity : 313852.3675021153
Sentence: `` certainly .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401

Sentence: there is one point , on which i want your advice .
Perplexity : 261550.7343412402

Sentence: `` that it ought not to be attempted .
Perplexity : 160996.36370093623
Sentence: mr. darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .
Perplexity : 331494.3063741798
Sentence: on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?
Perplexity : 190141.1265435961
Sentence: the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .
Perplexity : 266100.4431903059
Sentence: i am not equal to it .
Perplexity : 90265.88352182205
Sentence: wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .
Perplexity : 333273.82792186586
Sentence: sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .
Perplexity : 241194.1049104448
Sentence: at present i will say nothing about it . ''
Perplexity : 76672.9709413654
Sentence: `` you are quite right .

Perplexity : 408848.3572994162
Sentence: but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .
Perplexity : 269502.26470464113
Sentence: here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .
Perplexity : 359809.64333995484
Sentence: the liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value ! ''
Perplexity : 379157.8705101123
Sentence: she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister 's spirits .
Perplexity : 245253.71983330202
Sentence: jane was not happy .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .
Perplexity : 368321.22611596185
Sentence: `` well , lizzy , '' said mrs. bennet one day , `` what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane 's ?
Perplexity : 126409.45605335843
Sentence: for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .
Perplexity : 156192.1957151123
Sentence: i told my sister philips so the other day .
Perplexity : 356517.8609514372
Sentence: but i can not find out that jane saw any thing of him in london .
Perplexity : 97314.57562277517
Sentence: there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . ''
Perplexity : 134043.12261375974
Sentence: `` i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more . ''
Perplexity : 146874.08470677744
Sentence: `` oh , well !
Perplexity : 195067.88878288958
Sentence: it is just as he chooses .
Perplexity : 290279.48957358167
Sentence: nobody wants him to come .
Perplexity : 431120.1504621763
Sentence: though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .
Perplexity : 190244.40924312323
Sentence: `` well , lizzy , '' continued her mother soon afterwards , `` and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ?
Perplexity : 172062.5423910826
Sentence: and what sort of table do they keep ?
Perplexity : 349752.9733143893
Sentence: there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , i dare say . ''
Perplexity : 140690.92057549517
Sentence: `` a great deal of good management , depend upon it .
Perplexity : 135992.29278383256
Sentence: yes , yes .
Perplexity : 127139.27865290611
Sentence: they will take care not to outrun their income .
Perplexity : 528426.6984948734
Sentence: well , much good may it do them !
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead .
Perplexity : 151760.5354789159
Sentence: `` it was a subject which they could not mention before me . ''
Perplexity : 143278.7842255622
Sentence: `` no .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: it would have been strange if they had .
Perplexity : 102855.69003501335
Sentence: but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .
Perplexity : 328662.1932035343
Sentence: i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . ''
Perplexity : 196980.4388952886
Sentence: the first week of their return was soon gone .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: the second began .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: it was the last of the regiment 's stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .
Perplexity : 133911.02765272488
Sentence: the dejection was almost universal .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .
Perplexity : 364688.966105239
Sentence: very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family .
Perplexity : 286276.69225270534
Sentence: `` good heaven !
Perplexity : 127139.27865290611
Sentence: what is to become of us !
Perplexity : 125662.81597147083
Sentence: what are we to do ! ''
Perplexity : 467684.41098396695
Sentence: would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: `` how can you be smiling so , lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 115069.96364059493
Sentence: `` i am sure , '' said she , `` i cried for two days together when colonel millar 's regiment went away .
Perplexity : 97736.34405358981
Sentence: i thought i should have broke my heart . ''
Perplexity : 168226.2868685551
Sentence: `` i am sure i shall break mine , '' said lydia .
Perplexity : 113148.76831848465
Sentence: `` if one could but go to brighton ! ''
Perplexity : 143701.6196356674
Sentence: if one could but go to brighton !
Perplexity : 86994.50541895533
Sentence: `` a little sea bathing would set me up for ever . ''
Perplexity : 261001.09814444854
Sentence: `` and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , '' added kitty .
Perplexity : 112901.65836552651
Sentence: elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .
Perplexity : 426149.26050259976
Sentence: she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy 's objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .
Perplexity : 242778.2130103241
Sentence: but the gloom of lydia 's prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs. forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton .
Perplexity : 316023.9367140589
Sentence: this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .
Perplexity : 213586.82258387754
Sentence: a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two .
Perplexity : 274767.6905229646
Sentence: the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs. forster , the delight of mrs. bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described .
Perplexity : 202534.78788534497
Sentence: wholly inattentive to her sister 's feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one 's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .
Perplexity : 476409.5789254785
Sentence: `` i can not see why mrs. forster should not ask me as well as lydia , '' said she , `` though i am not her particular friend .
Perplexity : 142509.65833231414
Sentence: as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .
Perplexity : 292603.42243627086
Sentence: she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia 's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .
Perplexity : 269137.8833831303
Sentence: he heard her attentively , and then said , '' lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ''
Perplexity : 334117.2357906732
Sentence: `` if you were aware , '' said elizabeth , `` of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia 's unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair . ''
Perplexity : 209279.81955769757
Sentence: `` already arisen ! ''
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: `` what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?
Perplexity : 510273.37716250034
Sentence: such squeamish youths as can not bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .
Perplexity : 420266.2168846581
Sentence: come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia 's folly . ''
Perplexity : 446496.57796787855
Sentence: `` indeed you are mistaken .
Perplexity : 130622.66579859053
Sentence: i have no such injuries to resent .
Perplexity : 345184.62352528574
Sentence: it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining .
Perplexity : 209963.42290458054
Sentence: our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia 's character .
Perplexity : 340708.9489309378
Sentence: excuse me for i must speak plainly .
Perplexity : 493767.6223888879
Sentence: if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .
Perplexity : 158905.69808044142

Sentence: every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .

Sentence: they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .
Perplexity : 300521.2837462321
Sentence: amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .
Perplexity : 345595.7987990055
Sentence: at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .
Perplexity : 217672.21995689062

Sentence: or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?
Perplexity : 565518.6023158651
Sentence: had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .

Sentence: she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .
Perplexity : 239363.42241189207

Perplexity : 245222.23669625903
Sentence: never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .
Perplexity : 605214.1015512876
Sentence: what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing 's park , when he put his letter into her hand !
Perplexity : 500444.6452799951
Sentence: she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .
Perplexity : 143828.56531679526
Sentence: they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .
Perplexity : 247610.45038783381
Sentence: her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr. darcy then was .
Perplexity : 342369.55726183095
Sentence: she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .
Perplexity : 136785.40975492637
Sentence: they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .
Perplexity : 444276.08724787965
Sentence: mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .
Perplexity : 472310.69816690206
Sentence: with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .
Perplexity : 185321.111162944
Sentence: it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .
Perplexity : 307438.9021688257
Sentence: they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it .
Perplexity : 405460.1081870066
Sentence: elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .
Perplexity : 207031.76168049005
Sentence: her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .
Perplexity : 267439.2416764789
Sentence: whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth 's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .
Perplexity : 166230.71167723613
Sentence: the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .
Perplexity : 406604.6445755051
Sentence: elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .
Perplexity : 342843.9094846146
Sentence: for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .
Perplexity : 136171.88987552605
Sentence: this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .
Perplexity : 491017.2191346389
Sentence: with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words `` delightful , '' and `` charming , '' when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .
Perplexity : 246737.16017852767
Sentence: this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .
Perplexity : 291368.14410624653
Sentence: `` what will be his surprise , '' thought she , `` when he knows who they are !
Perplexity : 237934.62559122246
Sentence: he takes them now for people of fashion . ''
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .
Perplexity : 204827.91002687422
Sentence: that he was surprised by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr. gardiner .
Perplexity : 258393.7704548869
Sentence: elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .
Perplexity : 110632.33539071312
Sentence: it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .
Perplexity : 286553.12917450815
Sentence: she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .
Perplexity : 375417.79795225145
Sentence: the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .
Perplexity : 316484.75007679884
Sentence: mrs. gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .
Perplexity : 272884.45421173685
Sentence: elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .
Perplexity : 412590.2312598283
Sentence: her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , `` why is he so altered ?
Perplexity : 345034.3580153672
Sentence: from what can it proceed ?
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: it can not be for me , it can not be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .
Perplexity : 126933.85061870246
Sentence: my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .
Perplexity : 437596.71952642454
Sentence: it is impossible that he should still love me . ''
Perplexity : 147097.8417058042
Sentence: it originated in mrs. gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth 's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband 's .
Perplexity : 267555.08045978536
Sentence: mr. darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .
Perplexity : 153588.40891149186
Sentence: after a short silence , the lady first spoke .
Perplexity : 255557.46059910223
Sentence: she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected `` for your housekeeper , '' she added , `` informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . ''
Perplexity : 204330.76952003466
Sentence: he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .
Perplexity : 232324.65636818262
Sentence: `` they will join me early to morrow , '' he continued , `` and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , mr. bingley and his sisters . ''
Perplexity : 167817.97417066633
Sentence: elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .
Perplexity : 315616.56392787804
Sentence: her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingley 's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .
Perplexity : 261108.2010270271
Sentence: `` there is also one other person in the party , '' he continued after a pause , `` who more particularly wishes to be known to you , will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? ''
Perplexity : 306786.3682389608
Sentence: the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .
Perplexity : 265818.7565437089
Sentence: they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought .
Perplexity : 288317.36791008187
Sentence: elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .
Perplexity : 286394.5152543958
Sentence: his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .
Perplexity : 194259.78646331173

Perplexity : 173440.45375224066
Sentence: he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .
Perplexity : 340828.1650089263
Sentence: at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .
Perplexity : 219610.14214632803
Sentence: she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .
Perplexity : 285116.8942660518

Perplexity : 500243.6967779756
Sentence: on mr. and mrs. gardiner 's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .
Perplexity : 166761.50961021913
Sentence: mr. darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .
Perplexity : 285180.4564176144

Sentence: `` he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , '' said her uncle .
Perplexity : 327971.2385601472
Sentence: i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , i have seen nothing of it . ''
Perplexity : 210797.43633789412
Sentence: `` i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .
Perplexity : 173541.59093513415
Sentence: it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention .
Perplexity : 219930.66715293907
Sentence: his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling . ''
Perplexity : 460698.1921705781
Sentence: `` to be sure , lizzy , '' said her aunt , `` he is not so handsome as wickham ; or rather he has not wickham 's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .
Perplexity : 188225.15824088387
Sentence: but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? ''
Perplexity : 308593.4893157059
Sentence: elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .
Perplexity : 147113.37663681697
Sentence: elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .
Perplexity : 191497.4632212138
Sentence: `` from what we have seen of him , '' continued mrs. gardiner , `` i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham .
Perplexity : 199453.58213616445
Sentence: and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .
Perplexity : 292547.5689720514
Sentence: but to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character !
Perplexity : 258072.22976087383
Sentence: i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .
Perplexity : 286962.7082869758
Sentence: but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue . ''
Perplexity : 192143.2516641616
Sentence: elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham 's so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire .
Perplexity : 235243.84807315047
Sentence: mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .

Perplexity : 271356.65378139727
Sentence: the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr. darcy 's civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .
Perplexity : 238376.9078756311

Perplexity : 187923.768105613

Perplexity : 177680.16136067314
Sentence: she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .

Sentence: no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .
Perplexity : 362307.22975186695
Sentence: on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .
Perplexity : 278415.85154964065
Sentence: he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it `` was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; '' and , before she could reply , he added , `` it is above eight months .

Perplexity : 347859.84126637253
Sentence: when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .
Perplexity : 301191.9624460503
Sentence: never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .
Perplexity : 379808.42008997983

Perplexity : 138954.67520368338
Sentence: they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant 's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 254276.52888597365
Sentence: there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .

Perplexity : 250429.82160944853

Perplexity : 269406.4287245266
Sentence: she certainly did not hate him .
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999

Perplexity : 331837.2271040439
Sentence: the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .
Perplexity : 387479.0163659266
Sentence: but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .

Sentence: he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .
Perplexity : 325350.25941997225
Sentence: such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .
Perplexity : 300718.99597335863
Sentence: it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy 's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .
Perplexity : 219111.87582928734
Sentence: elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .

Perplexity : 266704.79586294206
Sentence: by mrs. hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .
Perplexity : 214188.80066818744
Sentence: it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .
Perplexity : 407552.8626389056
Sentence: miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .
Perplexity : 313191.15020010964
Sentence: elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .
Perplexity : 120872.2617776873
Sentence: this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .
Perplexity : 271094.60671844654
Sentence: her own thoughts were employing her .
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999
Sentence: she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .
Perplexity : 227166.46807733917
Sentence: she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .
Perplexity : 389393.7492424364
Sentence: after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley 's voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .
Perplexity : 228254.39731741877
Sentence: she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .
Perplexity : 214154.90139327684
Sentence: the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .
Perplexity : 380716.6599677869
Sentence: there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .
Perplexity : 354702.47192200075
Sentence: while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .
Perplexity : 274005.8353972474
Sentence: he had been some time with mr. gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .
Perplexity : 201896.98880788815
Sentence: no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .
Perplexity : 303212.2897189115
Sentence: in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley 's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over .
Perplexity : 278799.83587343013
Sentence: miss darcy , on her brother 's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .
Perplexity : 214270.736133086
Sentence: miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , '' pray , miss eliza , are not the shire militia removed from meryton ?
Perplexity : 285698.1081928951
Sentence: they must be a great loss to your family . ''
Perplexity : 193263.16250667174
Sentence: in darcy 's presence she dared not mention wickham 's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment 's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .
Perplexity : 364375.2308273418
Sentence: while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .
Perplexity : 300979.1285389605
Sentence: had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy 's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .
Perplexity : 320254.6730060841
Sentence: to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley 's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .
Perplexity : 371919.29905180616
Sentence: he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .
Perplexity : 276190.23575616535
Sentence: elizabeth 's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .
Perplexity : 252203.0945320843
Sentence: her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .
Perplexity : 280190.2140260976
Sentence: their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress .
Perplexity : 395941.59795211727
Sentence: but georgiana would not join her .
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999
Sentence: her brother 's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .
Perplexity : 280061.9887250391
Sentence: when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .
Perplexity : 177685.6312282751
Sentence: `` how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy , '' she cried ; `` i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .
Perplexity : 192495.75858533414
Sentence: she is grown so brown and coarse !
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again . ''
Perplexity : 187479.8670878861
Sentence: however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .
Perplexity : 411767.2434888943
Sentence: `` for my own part , '' she rejoined , `` i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her .
Perplexity : 194266.72900988936
Sentence: her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .
Perplexity : 427834.8628849195
Sentence: her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines .
Perplexity : 381873.40072560584
Sentence: her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .
Perplexity : 295978.06073610304
Sentence: they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . ''
Perplexity : 224796.75182055036
Sentence: persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .
Perplexity : 331220.5811123776
Sentence: he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , '' i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , 'she a beauty !
Perplexity : 235974.1523430906
Sentence: but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . ''
Perplexity : 312715.99138448713
Sentence: `` yes , '' replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , `` but that was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . ''
Perplexity : 175876.6950893022
Sentence: he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .
Perplexity : 193910.695892878
Sentence: mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .
Perplexity : 322346.25023838016
Sentence: the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .
Perplexity : 414357.4176050738
Sentence: elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .
Perplexity : 288785.3427738594
Sentence: elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill. they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .
Perplexity : 281092.67341416184
Sentence: the one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago .
Perplexity : 357111.189600132
Sentence: it was to this effect : `` since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well .
Perplexity : 227615.24345262107
Sentence: what i have to say relates to poor lydia .
Perplexity : 222566.9618137798
Sentence: imagine our surprise .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .
Perplexity : 153296.71937973212
Sentence: i am very , very sorry .
Perplexity : 195669.6190923593
Sentence: but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .

Sentence: but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .
Perplexity : 409415.930286894

Perplexity : 327900.9906059761
Sentence: for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .

Perplexity : 315195.37273561244
Sentence: mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant 's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .

Perplexity : 198986.8773911726
Sentence: oh , that i knew how it was ! ''
Perplexity : 151609.26746491247
Sentence: had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .
Perplexity : 279248.4696679173
Sentence: an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr. gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn .
Perplexity : 195323.22058778716
Sentence: `` i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , '' said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; `` and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .
Perplexity : 202743.19122243568
Sentence: it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel 's family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best .
Perplexity : 292670.6452063034

Sentence: cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .
Perplexity : 144156.7742130686
Sentence: `` upon my word , '' said mrs. gardiner , `` i begin to be of your uncle 's opinion .
Perplexity : 93733.33303340267

Perplexity : 269630.82304376713
Sentence: i can not think so very ill of wickham .
Perplexity : 72588.86269784876

Perplexity : 114911.07141550418
Sentence: `` not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .

Sentence: `` in the first place , '' replied mr. gardiner , `` there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland . ''
Perplexity : 74701.09007820155
Sentence: and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road . ''
Perplexity : 370069.12543504464
Sentence: `` well , then supposing them to be in london .
Perplexity : 86004.07640097824

Perplexity : 380514.3073552646
Sentence: as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .
Perplexity : 268087.0818689105
Sentence: but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good .
Perplexity : 202178.15183092127
Sentence: lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father 's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . ''
Perplexity : 286698.99492404313

Perplexity : 361930.356284211
Sentence: however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham .
Perplexity : 222581.77263902503
Sentence: i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .
Perplexity : 344680.65653739346

Perplexity : 305965.27836028184
Sentence: but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .
Perplexity : 290673.41432312

Perplexity : 286817.94110913435
Sentence: `` thank you , '' said lydia , `` for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry . ''
Perplexity : 148304.3855685666
Sentence: on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .
Perplexity : 199839.48507562364
Sentence: but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .
Perplexity : 233711.2405684265
Sentence: mr. darcy had been at her sister 's wedding .
Perplexity : 61908.08898681882
Sentence: it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .
Perplexity : 339124.12555753655
Sentence: conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .
Perplexity : 184720.2374023856
Sentence: those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .
Perplexity : 502549.5923012366
Sentence: she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .
Perplexity : 263605.6876471371
Sentence: `` you may readily comprehend , '' she added , `` what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .
Perplexity : 224643.80171026482
Sentence: pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . ''
Perplexity : 367199.3590128696
Sentence: `` not that i shall though , '' she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; `` and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . ''
Perplexity : 154861.01847450426
Sentence: jane 's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .
Perplexity : 334310.39751448564
Sentence: elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .
Perplexity : 157125.33452357785

Perplexity : 229135.9895562559
Sentence: i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from you .
Perplexity : 258482.7176094737
Sentence: do n't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .
Perplexity : 202330.9093069055
Sentence: your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .
Perplexity : 339561.08802451653
Sentence: but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit .
Perplexity : 244026.53467346003
Sentence: on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .
Perplexity : 286511.0536278979
Sentence: mr. darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .
Perplexity : 257062.10115671245
Sentence: it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your 's seems to have been .
Perplexity : 353565.284445261
Sentence: he came to tell mr. gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once .
Perplexity : 254274.90158424573
Sentence: from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .
Perplexity : 499156.2940313481
Sentence: the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .
Perplexity : 292968.7480903464
Sentence: he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .
Perplexity : 346669.4304537074
Sentence: there is a lady , it seems , a mrs. younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .
Perplexity : 191786.59695633536
Sentence: she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .
Perplexity : 417593.53589858575
Sentence: this mrs. younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .
Perplexity : 206995.79163308727
Sentence: but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .
Perplexity : 271943.67270628933
Sentence: she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .
Perplexity : 223769.202400313
Sentence: wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .
Perplexity : 180324.6540420283
Sentence: at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction .
Perplexity : 207882.52150110775
Sentence: his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .
Perplexity : 220325.4736186352
Sentence: but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .
Perplexity : 302057.46945833985
Sentence: she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham .
Perplexity : 198535.50998808726
Sentence: she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .
Perplexity : 149715.41883911326
Sentence: since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .
Perplexity : 309030.8256630651
Sentence: he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia 's flight , on her own folly alone .
Perplexity : 399001.3727152378
Sentence: he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .
Perplexity : 216772.0826920017
Sentence: mr. darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .
Perplexity : 309460.79048148595
Sentence: though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .
Perplexity : 146410.99983894738
Sentence: but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .
Perplexity : 368834.6996886339
Sentence: under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .
Perplexity : 187740.63374169823
Sentence: they met several times , for there was much to be discussed .
Perplexity : 224787.4573249104
Sentence: wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .
Perplexity : 333542.8998028151
Sentence: every thing being settled between them , mr. darcy 's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home .
Perplexity : 231847.602648985
Sentence: but mr. gardiner could not be seen , and mr. darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .
Perplexity : 209478.33168386246
Sentence: he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .
Perplexity : 305701.2910368186
Sentence: he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .

Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn .
Perplexity : 174213.43258845952
Sentence: but our visitor was very obstinate .
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999
Sentence: i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .
Perplexity : 324018.96248505294
Sentence: nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .
Perplexity : 184602.5623289067
Sentence: they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .
Perplexity : 382779.38487342215
Sentence: but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .
Perplexity : 330081.15375036164
Sentence: but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .
Perplexity : 368476.2241917239
Sentence: you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people .
Perplexity : 172484.793145374
Sentence: the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .
Perplexity : 171691.82514539734
Sentence: it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .
Perplexity : 228755.34527977437
Sentence: perhaps there was some truth in this ; though i doubt whether his reserve , or anybody 's reserve , can be answerable for the event .
Perplexity : 510689.3365244305
Sentence: but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .
Perplexity : 194391.20135003992
Sentence: when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .

Sentence: i believe i have now told you every thing .
Perplexity : 186629.1322335417

Sentence: lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house .
Perplexity : 322722.087495371
Sentence: he was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane 's letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .
Perplexity : 230031.97768559548
Sentence: i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .
Perplexity : 213996.45290191335

Perplexity : 205598.7909172518

Perplexity : 208111.472221037
Sentence: i thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401

Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park .

Perplexity : 387929.7833337846
Sentence: the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sister 's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !
Perplexity : 306513.44124015426
Sentence: he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .
Perplexity : 438074.62587733736

Sentence: her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .
Perplexity : 145106.59144107037
Sentence: but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .

Perplexity : 87754.08566869037

Sentence: to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley .

Sentence: but she would not be secure .
Perplexity : 89424.09121744879
Sentence: she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door .

Perplexity : 401410.71549252915

Sentence: darcy , after enquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .

Perplexity : 176482.46124455615

Perplexity : 120743.62252049359
Sentence: i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . ''
Perplexity : 337316.6244410183
Sentence: `` it is well .
Perplexity : 129094.64963630638
Sentence: you refuse , then , to oblige me .
Perplexity : 314590.58500061615
Sentence: `` neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , '' replied elizabeth , `` have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .
Perplexity : 190213.6655632296
Sentence: no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 230024.29185112956
Sentence: and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment 's concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . ''
Perplexity : 287795.4542175738
Sentence: `` and this is your real opinion !
Perplexity : 212102.60442921682
Sentence: this is your final resolve !

Sentence: do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .
Perplexity : 137979.23292807722
Sentence: i came to try you .
Perplexity : 431120.1504621763
Sentence: i hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it i will carry my point . ''
Perplexity : 331927.6590843503
Sentence: in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , '' i take no leave of you , miss bennet .
Perplexity : 151418.4938440892
Sentence: i send no compliments to your mother .
Perplexity : 493767.6223888879
Sentence: you deserve no such attention .
Perplexity : 431120.15046217554
Sentence: i am most seriously displeased . ''
Perplexity : 467684.41098396695
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .
Perplexity : 204785.30771078062
Sentence: she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .
Perplexity : 472768.37118508725
Sentence: her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself .
Perplexity : 388129.3497888573
Sentence: `` she is a very fine looking woman !
Perplexity : 109674.70810308008
Sentence: for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well .
Perplexity : 276261.4543692314
Sentence: she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you .
Perplexity : 281362.3831546024
Sentence: i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 171595.70818628796
Sentence: elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .
Perplexity : 353649.56942298065
Sentence: lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 348038.0144829318
Sentence: it was a rational scheme to be sure !
Perplexity : 143676.83762773726
Sentence: but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .
Perplexity : 349525.8177101723
Sentence: she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .
Perplexity : 234816.62501356282
Sentence: and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .
Perplexity : 372265.2417254343
Sentence: in revolving lady catherine 's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .
Perplexity : 172562.86773041927
Sentence: from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .
Perplexity : 308470.85378361435
Sentence: with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .
Perplexity : 491111.2251848685
Sentence: if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .
Perplexity : 352510.77833923494
Sentence: in that case he would return no more .
Perplexity : 349752.9733143893
Sentence: lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way .
Perplexity : 366753.59188668535
Sentence: `` if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , '' she added , `` i shall know how to understand it .
Perplexity : 155566.17343482169
Sentence: if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all . ''
Perplexity : 208155.95432643016
Sentence: the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs. bennet 's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .
Perplexity : 170112.1938811101
Sentence: the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .
Perplexity : 144630.0990819126
Sentence: `` lizzy , '' said he , `` i was going to look for you ; come into my room . ''
Perplexity : 129070.84411790199
Sentence: she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .
Perplexity : 275588.436681857
Sentence: it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .
Perplexity : 309058.8651798516
Sentence: she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .
Perplexity : 164152.17138459842
Sentence: as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .
Perplexity : 269124.7236962066
Sentence: i did not know before , that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .
Perplexity : 138770.95806526634
Sentence: let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . ''
Perplexity : 467684.41098396695
Sentence: the colour now rushed into elizabeth 's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , '' you look conscious .
Perplexity : 322103.6150664732
Sentence: this letter is from mr .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: collins . ''
Perplexity : 127139.27865290611
Sentence: `` from mr. collins !
Perplexity : 153797.1872933604
Sentence: and what can he have to say ? ''
Perplexity : 131383.0754971098
Sentence: `` something very much to the purpose of course .
Perplexity : 251443.13123075257
Sentence: he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , gossiping lucases .
Perplexity : 330137.4765171596
Sentence: i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .
Perplexity : 345715.54887460684
Sentence: what relates to yourself , is as follows .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: `` having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority .
Perplexity : 350147.9245000176
Sentence: your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . ''
Perplexity : 290494.425454597
Sentence: `` can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? ''
Perplexity : 215697.82992485756
Sentence: `` this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .
Perplexity : 647695.9506133953
Sentence: yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman 's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . ''
Perplexity : 295209.78166629374
Sentence: `` have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ?
Perplexity : 235134.52414514378
Sentence: but now it comes out . ''
Perplexity : 378560.93560011516
Sentence: we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . ''
Perplexity : 221547.00500732067
Sentence: `` mr. darcy , you see , is the man !
Perplexity : 99441.62656735223
Sentence: now , lizzy , i think i have surprised you .
Perplexity : 115496.0709645722
Sentence: could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?
Perplexity : 398191.5117499289
Sentence: mr. darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !
Perplexity : 306695.61353582976
Sentence: it is admirable ! ''
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: elizabeth tried to join in her father 's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .
Perplexity : 346335.09937635466
Sentence: never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .
Perplexity : 233844.00582463693
Sentence: `` are you not diverted ? ''
Perplexity : 378560.93560011516
Sentence: <s> yes .
Perplexity : 127139.27865290611
Sentence: pray read on . ''
Perplexity : 169999.03783000482
Sentence: `` after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .
Perplexity : 314669.090486319
Sentence: i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . ''
Perplexity : 305632.2583203616
Sentence: `` mr. collins moreover adds , '' `` i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .
Perplexity : 385457.87339398963
Sentence: i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .
Perplexity : 313684.8507305536
Sentence: it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it .
Perplexity : 289859.99911998556
Sentence: you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . ''
Perplexity : 612334.4850740177
Sentence: but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .
Perplexity : 214935.97710812773
Sentence: you are not going to be missish , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .
Perplexity : 181048.72110446537
Sentence: for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? ''
Perplexity : 417979.3859490049
Sentence: cried elizabeth , `` i am excessively diverted .
Perplexity : 30144.373775597098
Sentence: but it is so strange ! ''
Perplexity : 134959.1066870313
Sentence: had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !
Perplexity : 253818.142732467
Sentence: nay , when i read a letter of his , i can not help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law .
Perplexity : 284852.03297127463
Sentence: did she call to refuse her consent ? ''
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .
Perplexity : 269464.805616909
Sentence: elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .
Perplexity : 196936.64657879874
Sentence: it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .
Perplexity : 280195.10895937396
Sentence: her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr. darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .
Perplexity : 226236.64740339265
Sentence: instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine 's visit .
Perplexity : 341305.5148149278
Sentence: the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out .
Perplexity : 338857.5201969241
Sentence: it was agreed to .
Perplexity : 376421.1659632553
Sentence: mrs. bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .
Perplexity : 166913.35159489763
Sentence: bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .
Perplexity : 210525.23848863092
Sentence: they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other .
Perplexity : 190855.8496712456
Sentence: very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .
Perplexity : 362082.07515202684
Sentence: they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .
Perplexity : 358559.61300438165
Sentence: i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .
Perplexity : 456932.01479954616
Sentence: ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it .
Perplexity : 215692.79214379014
Sentence: were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express . ''
Perplexity : 153803.1891133532
Sentence: `` you must not blame my aunt .
Perplexity : 214546.76155183226
Sentence: lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars .
Perplexity : 193474.77373068678
Sentence: let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . ''
Perplexity : 249644.39360706325
Sentence: `` if you will thank me , '' he replied , `` let it be for yourself alone .
Perplexity : 107997.27372248039
Sentence: that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny .
Perplexity : 259385.25460144697
Sentence: but your family owe me nothing .
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999
Sentence: much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of you . ''
Perplexity : 146019.10986672822
Sentence: elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .
Perplexity : 259167.7483184311
Sentence: after a short pause , her companion added , `` you are too generous to trifle with me .
Perplexity : 129563.87010155339
Sentence: my affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . ''
Perplexity : 352881.56084096094
Sentence: elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .
Perplexity : 389057.84824583883
Sentence: the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .
Perplexity : 331366.7163690727
Sentence: had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .
Perplexity : 231086.90728906356
Sentence: they walked on , without knowing in what direction .
Perplexity : 290867.2750518264
Sentence: there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .
Perplexity : 209035.9895038109
Sentence: she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship 's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give .
Perplexity : 290877.0901016619
Sentence: but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .
Perplexity : 472836.84593244095
Sentence: elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , `` yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .
Perplexity : 248923.8190265755
Sentence: after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . ''
Perplexity : 454006.26549733116
Sentence: `` what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ?
Perplexity : 111718.69703577265
Sentence: for , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .
Perplexity : 382800.4401075509
Sentence: it was unpardonable .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: `` i can not be so easily reconciled to myself .
Perplexity : 61936.67960068553
Sentence: the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .
Perplexity : 243738.0978494712
Sentence: your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : 'had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . '
Perplexity : 225568.83400058042
Sentence: those were your words .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice . ''
Perplexity : 273969.0680284054
Sentence: `` i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .
Perplexity : 349752.97331438994
Sentence: i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . ''
Perplexity : 123179.1219300106
Sentence: the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . ''
Perplexity : 269423.6485618103
Sentence: do not repeat what i then said .
Perplexity : 376421.16596325394
Sentence: these recollections will not do at all .
Perplexity : 190301.00939383582
Sentence: i assure you , that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it . ''
Perplexity : 74646.74242207869
Sentence: darcy mentioned his letter .
Perplexity : 292511.9476980122
Sentence: `` did it , '' said he , `` did it soon make you think better of me ?
Perplexity : 192392.47952929215
Sentence: did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? ''
Perplexity : 571451.7048594168
Sentence: she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .
Perplexity : 376467.52882893063
Sentence: `` i knew , '' said he , `` that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .
Perplexity : 140728.45230888214
Sentence: i hope you have destroyed the letter .
Perplexity : 220265.3309872488
Sentence: i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . ''
Perplexity : 388228.9465003888
Sentence: `` the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . ''
Perplexity : 307285.5186691819
Sentence: `` when i wrote that letter , '' replied darcy , `` i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . ''
Perplexity : 201132.94652010902
Sentence: `` the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .
Perplexity : 230815.0269285738
Sentence: the adieu is charity itself .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: but think no more of the letter .
Perplexity : 74352.52512078072
Sentence: you must learn some of my philosophy .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . ''
Perplexity : 358300.1766589929
Sentence: `` i can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .

Sentence: but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley . ''
Perplexity : 373940.7995431175

Perplexity : 297019.9069177358

Perplexity : 308722.9693487788
Sentence: but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .
Perplexity : 173089.48810966854
Sentence: how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton !
Perplexity : 498236.5021628213
Sentence: elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .
Perplexity : 193889.52051176323
Sentence: but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia 's marriage .
Perplexity : 319843.50497822626

Perplexity : 550379.2321293823
Sentence: `` good gracious ! ''
Perplexity : 53852.4955355234

Perplexity : 180112.15860637403
Sentence: what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?
Perplexity : 276936.85807200556
Sentence: i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .
Perplexity : 310427.11979575653
Sentence: what shall we do with him ?
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999
Sentence: lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley 's way . ''
Perplexity : 129386.11256324878
Sentence: elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .
Perplexity : 467684.41098396445
Sentence: as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , `` mr. bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day ? ''
Perplexity : 258401.223186476
Sentence: `` i advise mr. darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , '' said mrs. bennet , `` to walk to oakham mount this morning .
Perplexity : 130372.15350694
Sentence: it is a nice long walk , and mr. darcy has never seen the view . ''
Perplexity : 188878.29510158967
Sentence: `` it may do very well for the others , '' replied mr. bingley ; `` but i am sure it will be too much for kitty .
Perplexity : 120128.45280219488
Sentence: wont it , kitty ? ''
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .
Perplexity : 190707.46493223426
Sentence: as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs. bennet followed her , saying , '' i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .
Perplexity : 199264.69963933193
Sentence: but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane 's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .
Perplexity : 119867.78968296864
Sentence: during their walk , it was resolved that mr. bennet 's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .
Perplexity : 146052.00587637603
Sentence: elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother 's .
Perplexity : 282835.47309421236
Sentence: she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .
Perplexity : 430893.0689542936
Sentence: but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .
Perplexity : 281726.00175576087
Sentence: in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
Perplexity : 185881.76299065026
Sentence: she did not fear her father 's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .
Perplexity : 214580.7167829809
Sentence: in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , `` go to your father , he wants you in the library . ''
Perplexity : 251831.63150244803
Sentence: she was gone directly .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: `` lizzy , '' said he , `` what are you doing ?
Perplexity : 61023.76913709595
Sentence: are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?
Perplexity : 422896.5375131627
Sentence: have not you always hated him ? ''
Perplexity : 383265.6539728981
Sentence: how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
Perplexity : 518263.22767284216
Sentence: it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 220405.2291455845
Sentence: `` or in other words , you are determined to have him .
Perplexity : 228611.46870250776
Sentence: but will they make you happy ? ''
Perplexity : 493767.6223888862
Sentence: `` have you any other objection , '' said elizabeth , `` than your belief of my indifference ? ''
Perplexity : 171995.5987545206
Sentence: `` none at all .
Perplexity : 92801.80326065319
Sentence: we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . ''
Perplexity : 235203.7540368487
Sentence: `` i do , i do like him , '' she replied , with tears in her eyes , `` i love him .
Perplexity : 74498.79360924993
Sentence: indeed he has no improper pride .
Perplexity : 647695.9506133999
Sentence: he is perfectly amiable .
Perplexity : 218764.52068435148
Sentence: you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . ''
Perplexity : 202357.36986441226
Sentence: `` lizzy , '' said her father , `` i have given him my consent .
Perplexity : 57883.548446161396
Sentence: he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .
Perplexity : 159475.477115489
Sentence: i now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .
Perplexity : 210373.63783772063
Sentence: but let me advise you to think better of it .
Perplexity : 126536.72035532298
Sentence: i know your disposition , lizzy .
Perplexity : 290279.48957358167
Sentence: i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .
Perplexity : 489722.1613017111
Sentence: you could scarcely escape discredit and misery .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: my child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .
Perplexity : 375116.1599405754
Sentence: you know not what you are about . ''
Perplexity : 205795.42169730435
Sentence: elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
Perplexity : 362388.3970255208
Sentence: `` well , my dear , '' said he , when she ceased speaking , `` i have no more to say .
Perplexity : 31179.151502171346
Sentence: if this be the case , he deserves you .
Perplexity : 299861.7263940445
Sentence: i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy . ''
Perplexity : 151599.98079846826

Perplexity : 191008.45984377366
Sentence: `` this is an evening of wonders , indeed !
Perplexity : 262825.01653719024
Sentence: and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow 's debts , and got him his commission !
Perplexity : 413695.4811948529
Sentence: so much the better .
Perplexity : 32445.94443306632
Sentence: it will save me a world of trouble and economy .
Perplexity : 647695.950613401
Sentence: had it been your uncle 's doing , i must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .
Perplexity : 377769.8561985699
