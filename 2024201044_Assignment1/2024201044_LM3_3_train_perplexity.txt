Perplexity : 3.218099434744635
Sentence: elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .
Perplexity : 2.715259567444769

Sentence: they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .
Perplexity : 2.6635093561895573

Sentence: mr. bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .
Perplexity : 2.5360829924994315
Sentence: his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs. hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .

Perplexity : 2.8494440380311223

Sentence: the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .
Perplexity : 2.39108271165602
Sentence: bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .
Perplexity : 2.9249364430211404
Sentence: darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .

Sentence: the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .
Perplexity : 1.8064031441112198

Perplexity : 2.5325580814538564

Perplexity : 2.5531857319523197
Sentence: `` his pride , '' said miss lucas , `` does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .
Perplexity : 2.7824925671648666
Sentence: one can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .

Sentence: if i may so express it , he has a right to be proud . ''
Perplexity : 3.0947790122306946

Perplexity : 2.4334558047856576

Sentence: a person may be proud without being vain .
Perplexity : 2.8503238506127038

Perplexity : 2.8377349887628407
Sentence: by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother 's admiration .
Perplexity : 2.916265627458211
Sentence: she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas .
Perplexity : 2.769292106856986
Sentence: `` it may perhaps be pleasant , '' replied charlotte , `` to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .
Perplexity : 2.7636496271968443
Sentence: if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .

Sentence: `` but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .
Perplexity : 3.3744576622899785

Perplexity : 2.585296764069454
Sentence: `` remember , eliza , that he does not know jane 's disposition as you do . ''
Perplexity : 2.9703278716226214
Sentence: `` but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . ''
Perplexity : 3.1776628951839494
Sentence: `` perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .
Perplexity : 3.4680356636915635
Sentence: but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .
Perplexity : 2.728139426747976
Sentence: when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . ''
Perplexity : 2.793329057164179

Sentence: but these are not jane 's feelings ; she is not acting by design .
Perplexity : 3.451957280507437

Sentence: this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . ''
Perplexity : 3.054422652446438
Sentence: `` not as you represent it .
Perplexity : 2.382675023937508
Sentence: had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . ''
Perplexity : 2.5895705051669378
Sentence: `` well , '' said charlotte , `` i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .

Sentence: happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .
Perplexity : 2.1529770100122962

Sentence: `` you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .

Sentence: you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . ''
Perplexity : 3.367092380800905
Sentence: mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .
Perplexity : 3.0738280715180455
Sentence: to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .
Perplexity : 2.0269170342479725
Sentence: though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .
Perplexity : 2.299932736692059
Sentence: of this she was perfectly unaware ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .
Perplexity : 3.137855407334046
Sentence: he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .

Perplexity : 3.04877651237975
Sentence: `` but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about .
Perplexity : 3.372049824384307
Sentence: he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him . ''
Perplexity : 2.545738759241343
Sentence: on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , '' did not you think , mr. darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? ''
Perplexity : 3.050562932322747

Perplexity : 2.6534366682629895
Sentence: on miss lucas 's persevering , however , she added , `` very well ; if it must be so , it must . ''
Perplexity : 3.2149884891461222
Sentence: and gravely glancing at mr. darcy , `` there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and i shall keep mine to swell my song . ''
Perplexity : 2.251044606292688
Sentence: mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .
Perplexity : 2.408128703214983
Sentence: elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .
Perplexity : 2.5589880991652927
Sentence: mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began .
Perplexity : 2.698940707202552
Sentence: `` what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 3.0253408320207473

Perplexity : 2.716540841784676

Perplexity : 2.5459689897218727
Sentence: jane was by no means better .
Perplexity : 2.9876973502206057
Sentence: the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .
Perplexity : 2.6186940760705557
Sentence: their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .
Perplexity : 3.408800085368612

Sentence: her hair so untidy , so blowsy ! ''
Perplexity : 1.639874039279766

Sentence: what could she mean by it ?
Perplexity : 3.2212163786648733
Sentence: `` it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , '' said bingley .
Perplexity : 3.1297108126988666
Sentence: `` i am afraid , mr. darcy , '' observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , '' that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . ''
Perplexity : 2.6841857172432233
Sentence: `` not at all , '' he replied ; `` they were brightened by the exercise . ''
Perplexity : 2.677746783781714

Sentence: `` that is capital , '' added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .
Perplexity : 2.7730924074257706
Sentence: `` if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside , '' cried bingley , `` it would not make them one jot less agreeable . ''

Perplexity : 2.5764778740900853

Sentence: `` i have not the smallest objection to explaining them , '' said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .
Perplexity : 2.718736873576637

Perplexity : 2.554647755852861
Sentence: `` her daughter , miss de bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . ''
Perplexity : 2.981124973654591
Sentence: this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley .
Perplexity : 2.8858938890765473
Sentence: vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another .
Perplexity : 2.7693852442121765
Sentence: `` mr. collins , '' said she , `` speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . ''
Perplexity : 2.57161112261721
Sentence: `` i believe her to be both in a great degree , '' replied wickham ; `` i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .
Perplexity : 3.1184523238522113
Sentence: she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . ''
Perplexity : 2.589172636373415
Sentence: elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr. wickham 's attentions .

Sentence: she could think of nothing but of mr. wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent .
Perplexity : 3.523182760983994
Sentence: elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr. wickham and herself .
Perplexity : 3.1539154691132034
Sentence: jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr. bingley 's regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham .
Perplexity : 2.860530010551775
Sentence: the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .
Perplexity : 2.6576928446511507

Sentence: `` very true , indeed ; and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?

Perplexity : 2.5605357241121807
Sentence: `` laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .
Perplexity : 2.987993411654813
Sentence: my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr. darcy , to be treating his father 's favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for .
Perplexity : 2.8162424303912648
Sentence: it is impossible .

Sentence: no . ''
Perplexity : 1.8127322074351004
Sentence: `` i can much more easily believe mr. bingley 's being imposed on , than that mr. wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony .
Perplexity : 2.640925569871044
Sentence: if it be not so , let mr. darcy contradict it .
Perplexity : 2.8714015244759556
Sentence: besides , there was truth in his looks . ''
Perplexity : 2.801839193002835
Sentence: `` it is difficult indeed it is distressing .
Perplexity : 2.228328216580162
Sentence: one does not know what to think . ''
Perplexity : 2.8295562487753165
Sentence: `` i beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . ''
Perplexity : 2.442898120944926
Sentence: but jane could think with certainty on only one point , that mr. bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .
Perplexity : 2.837660694560753
Sentence: the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday .
Perplexity : 2.795946420904181
Sentence: the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .
Perplexity : 2.562566112429854
Sentence: to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding mrs. bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .

Sentence: the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .
Perplexity : 2.8183420548512608
Sentence: jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr. wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr. darcy 's looks and behaviour .
Perplexity : 2.9823643277907457
Sentence: the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .
Perplexity : 2.797258039368206
Sentence: and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .
Perplexity : 2.709424727450371
Sentence: i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .
Perplexity : 2.4115638798565002
Sentence: society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body . ''
Perplexity : 2.1942389654197467
Sentence: elizabeth 's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley 's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening 's amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance .
Perplexity : 2.6740641192312173
Sentence: `` i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , '' said he , `` that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . ''
Perplexity : 2.8263206634628606
Sentence: elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .
Perplexity : 2.645326593158205
Sentence: she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances : and to have mr. collins instead !
Perplexity : 2.6645750160473702
Sentence: her liveliness had been never worse timed .
Perplexity : 2.310326917834604
Sentence: there was no help for it however .
Perplexity : 3.5662928199784094
Sentence: mr. wickham 's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr. collins 's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .
Perplexity : 2.760608120921729
Sentence: she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .
Perplexity : 3.2231409666662154
Sentence: it now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .
Perplexity : 2.4565049135611137
Sentence: the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .
Perplexity : 2.7084905045585224
Sentence: elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .
Perplexity : 2.6878565259984164
Sentence: if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once .
Perplexity : 2.9954358691850222
Sentence: no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy .
Perplexity : 2.228846262580451
Sentence: even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia .
Perplexity : 2.5091188440753434
Sentence: till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .
Perplexity : 2.607156644123703
Sentence: the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .
Perplexity : 2.281452494768
Sentence: she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .
Perplexity : 2.5433371549005623
Sentence: this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .
Perplexity : 2.6668821859899037
Sentence: attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .
Perplexity : 2.2871270364230054
Sentence: but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .
Perplexity : 2.849375634692548
Sentence: the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .
Perplexity : 2.449502525369963
Sentence: mr. collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .
Perplexity : 2.4028405765415424
Sentence: the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .
Perplexity : 2.369212491787806
Sentence: she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .
Perplexity : 2.872981208289285
Sentence: he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her .
Perplexity : 2.5928132404605297
Sentence: `` heaven forbid !
Perplexity : 1.5706711981753045
Sentence: to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !
Perplexity : 2.7306476082490785
Sentence: do not wish me such an evil . ''
Perplexity : 2.6805370252008296
Sentence: when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .
Perplexity : 2.528675073989973
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .
Perplexity : 2.3986751286965404
Sentence: they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .
Perplexity : 2.726043393802879
Sentence: he replied , and was again silent .
Perplexity : 3.563175042092989
Sentence: after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with '' it is your turn to say something now , mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 2.797722956290757
Sentence: i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . ''
Perplexity : 2.4760567503418653
Sentence: he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .
Perplexity : 3.1577559349625615
Sentence: `` very well .
Perplexity : 2.516869908581511
Sentence: that reply will do for the present .
Perplexity : 2.79313328936266
Sentence: perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .
Perplexity : 1.8808336507770136
Sentence: but now we may be silent . ''
Perplexity : 3.2569373641889303
Sentence: `` do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? ''
Perplexity : 2.728445071144964
Sentence: `` sometimes .
Perplexity : 1.7403674944451015
Sentence: one must speak a little , you know .
Perplexity : 3.4173075061087945
Sentence: `` are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? ''
Perplexity : 2.7578393916166544
Sentence: `` both , '' replied elizabeth archly ; `` for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .
Perplexity : 2.584732859994162
Sentence: we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . ''
Perplexity : 2.3216093138861282
Sentence: `` this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , '' said he .
Perplexity : 2.906065119628609
Sentence: `` how near it may be to mine , i can not pretend to say .
Perplexity : 2.9148118918418473
Sentence: you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly . ''
Perplexity : 2.3809350589138076
Sentence: `` i must not decide on my own performance . ''
Perplexity : 2.5799176469209932
Sentence: he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton .
Perplexity : 3.2451492830778768
Sentence: she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , `` when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . ''
Perplexity : 2.6349372167211556
Sentence: the effect was immediate .
Perplexity : 2.4821435068009188
Sentence: at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , '' mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . ''
Perplexity : 2.730202419325679
Sentence: `` he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , '' replied elizabeth with emphasis , `` and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . ''
Perplexity : 3.0295628096149154
Sentence: at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr. darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .
Perplexity : 2.5804253838246676
Sentence: `` i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir .
Perplexity : 3.163072848774707
Sentence: such very superior dancing is not often seen .
Perplexity : 2.70397769356636
Sentence: allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley , ) shall take place .
Perplexity : 2.789669265580867
Sentence: what congratulations will then flow in !
Perplexity : 1.7853302811529908
Sentence: i appeal to mr. darcy : but let me not interrupt you , sir .
Perplexity : 2.5398264660618897
Sentence: you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . ''
Perplexity : 2.142957958387249
Sentence: recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , '' sir william 's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . ''
Perplexity : 2.7064326973107344
Sentence: sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .
Perplexity : 3.091987843407188

Sentence: `` books oh !
Perplexity : 1.7169262953802722
Sentence: <s> no .

Sentence: i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . ''
Perplexity : 3.0623220950429872
Sentence: we may compare our different opinions . ''
Perplexity : 1.6432814438124812
Sentence: `` no i can not talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of something else . ''
Perplexity : 2.75596573225215
Sentence: said he , with a look of doubt .
Perplexity : 2.888678993173188
Sentence: `` yes , always , '' she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , `` i remember hearing you once say , mr. darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .
Perplexity : 2.7676894454139056
Sentence: `` and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? ''
Perplexity : 2.362161399730171
Sentence: `` i hope not . ''
Perplexity : 3.14587213761193
Sentence: `` may i ask to what these questions tend ? ''
Perplexity : 2.1219413161055938
Sentence: `` merely to the illustration of your character , '' said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .
Perplexity : 2.187284733647879
Sentence: `` i am trying to make it out . ''
Perplexity : 2.5849554597694637
Sentence: she shook her head .
Perplexity : 1.8746836755354515
Sentence: `` i do not get on at all .
Perplexity : 2.749291398653945
Sentence: `` i can readily believe , '' answered he gravely , `` that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . ''
Perplexity : 2.7350886871893993
Sentence: `` i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , '' he coldly replied .
Perplexity : 2.6203685514425263
Sentence: she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy 's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .
Perplexity : 2.687404837444664
Sentence: they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , '' so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !
Perplexity : 2.915686065844567
Sentence: your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr. darcy 's steward .
Perplexity : 2.9226678345248454
Sentence: his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .
Perplexity : 2.8923121402512684
Sentence: i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ''
Perplexity : 2.6708675468399186
Sentence: `` his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , '' said elizabeth angrily ; `` for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcy 's steward , and of that , i can assure you , he informed me himself . ''
Perplexity : 2.807419743996583
Sentence: `` i beg your pardon , '' replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .
Perplexity : 2.5489630365266005
Sentence: `` excuse my interference .
Perplexity : 2.0124268510308574
Sentence: `` insolent girl ! ''
Perplexity : 2.117127838716987
Sentence: said elizabeth to herself .
Perplexity : 4.689460760227381
Sentence: `` you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .
Perplexity : 2.688393987858933
Sentence: jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .
Perplexity : 2.414271499774069
Sentence: elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane 's being in the fairest way for happiness .
Perplexity : 2.6366824732590675
Sentence: `` i want to know , '' said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister 's , `` what you have learnt about mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 3.1087352756611892
Sentence: but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ''
Perplexity : 2.8938679122999416
Sentence: mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister 's , mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
Perplexity : 3.125485391393413

Sentence: i am perfectly satisfied .
Perplexity : 3.1770304903273514
Sentence: but what does he say of the living ? ''
Perplexity : 2.666694898960868
Sentence: `` he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only . ''
Perplexity : 2.8305666210683316
Sentence: `` i have not a doubt of mr. bingley 's sincerity , '' said elizabeth warmly ; '' but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
Perplexity : 2.7415142833685233
Sentence: she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .
Perplexity : 2.7689528832694026
Sentence: elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley 's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .
Perplexity : 2.5745103769423934
Sentence: on their being joined by mr. bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr. collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
Perplexity : 2.895532027699925

Sentence: how wonderfully these sort of things occur !
Perplexity : 2.116146518000189

Sentence: i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .

Perplexity : 3.8914908973211744
Sentence: it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night . ''
Perplexity : 2.9154070908808327
Sentence: elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr. darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .
Perplexity : 2.749468987600572
Sentence: mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , '' my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .
Perplexity : 2.4713863061288093
Sentence: you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty .
Perplexity : 2.563181060617115
Sentence: and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .
Perplexity : 2.371079650944407
Sentence: her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words `` apology , '' '' hunsford , '' and `` lady catherine de bourgh . ''
Perplexity : 2.7259508960335546
Sentence: it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .
Perplexity : 3.0522907485115467
Sentence: mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr. collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .
Perplexity : 2.6395697645054117
Sentence: mr. collins then returned to elizabeth .
Perplexity : 4.205383790857022
Sentence: `` i have no reason , i assure you , '' said he , `` to be dissatisfied with my reception .
Perplexity : 2.730234418518111
Sentence: mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .
Perplexity : 3.205433817622153
Sentence: he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine 's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .
Perplexity : 2.617813314076741
Sentence: it was really a very handsome thought .
Perplexity : 3.1046704713580735
Sentence: as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .
Perplexity : 2.67175763507892
Sentence: she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley 's two sisters .
Perplexity : 2.9287493381149545
Sentence: her mother 's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .
Perplexity : 2.529116090531987
Sentence: when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr. bingley .
Perplexity : 2.7815334017215623
Sentence: it was an animating subject , and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .
Perplexity : 2.4616137676801455
Sentence: his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .
Perplexity : 3.0686941508661247
Sentence: it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane 's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .
Perplexity : 2.882787694034916
Sentence: it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .
Perplexity : 2.835201560404674
Sentence: she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .
Perplexity : 2.501542286903722
Sentence: in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother 's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy , who sat opposite to them .
Perplexity : 2.4949201389157545
Sentence: her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .
Perplexity : 2.635044900791925
Sentence: `` what is mr. darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ?
Perplexity : 3.9454062050985526
Sentence: `` for heaven 's sake , madam , speak lower .
Perplexity : 2.122934376916599

Sentence: elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .
Perplexity : 1.8596139702461048
Sentence: she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr. darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .
Perplexity : 2.925237538681362
Sentence: at length however mrs. bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .
Perplexity : 2.552257341973168
Sentence: elizabeth now began to revive .
Perplexity : 2.1275812541407166
Sentence: but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .
Perplexity : 2.6246374630600764
Sentence: by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .
Perplexity : 2.5071246776245775
Sentence: mary 's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected .
Perplexity : 2.336012065549664
Sentence: she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley .
Perplexity : 3.354564331334588
Sentence: she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .
Perplexity : 2.784279570182246
Sentence: she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night .
Perplexity : 2.2711318119271557

Perplexity : 2.7041175304829315
Sentence: you have delighted us long enough .
Perplexity : 2.560668765270029
Sentence: let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . ''
Perplexity : 2.5757762638098742
Sentence: mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father 's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .
Perplexity : 2.871345560705593
Sentence: others of the party were now applied to .
Perplexity : 3.22857697077963
Sentence: `` if i , '' said mr. collins , `` were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .
Perplexity : 2.7979112678609908
Sentence: i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .
Perplexity : 2.766671164195066
Sentence: in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .
Perplexity : 2.440792148785793
Sentence: and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .
Perplexity : 2.4297869606268447
Sentence: i can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . ''
Perplexity : 2.4964486284045146
Sentence: and with a bow to mr. darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .
Perplexity : 2.659490584506669
Sentence: many stared .
Perplexity : 1.7405719909494728
Sentence: many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .
Perplexity : 2.8339202830452734
Sentence: to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .
Perplexity : 2.973753854496956
Sentence: the rest of the evening brought her little amusement .
Perplexity : 2.4823481281923887
Sentence: in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .
Perplexity : 2.76750681806952
Sentence: he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .

Sentence: there was no arguing upon such a project .
Perplexity : 2.0238263839784945
Sentence: she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good naturedly engaged mr. collins 's conversation to herself .
Perplexity : 2.570642343942494
Sentence: she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy 's farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .
Perplexity : 2.846436519338309
Sentence: she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham , and rejoiced in it .
Perplexity : 2.746635210414304
Sentence: the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .
Perplexity : 2.7747452082572273
Sentence: mrs. hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .
Perplexity : 2.5911810295739652
Sentence: they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins , who was complimenting mr. bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .
Perplexity : 2.6610585231548454
Sentence: darcy said nothing at all .

Sentence: mr. bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .
Perplexity : 2.918706046685706
Sentence: mr. bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .
Perplexity : 2.8507834745618688
Sentence: elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of `` lord , how tired i am ! ''
Perplexity : 2.3892758004383685
Sentence: accompanied by a violent yawn .
Perplexity : 2.1149487536038425
Sentence: when at length they arose to take leave , mrs. bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .
Perplexity : 2.811801331958141
Sentence: bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .
Perplexity : 2.8447882870295502
Sentence: mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months .
Perplexity : 2.4967847900176054
Sentence: elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield .

Sentence: mr. collins made his declaration in form .
Perplexity : 2.5201763659961163
Sentence: having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .
Perplexity : 2.760291574003798
Sentence: on finding mrs. bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , '' may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? ''
Perplexity : 2.8557925314695023

Perplexity : 2.580099581467235
Sentence: collins . ''
Perplexity : 1.6432759949214055
Sentence: elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment 's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .

Perplexity : 2.5651406292645085

Sentence: you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .

Sentence: thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women .

Sentence: i am perfectly serious in my refusal .
Perplexity : 2.8124036017904017
Sentence: you could not make me happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so .
Perplexity : 3.2597472486749783
Sentence: nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . ''
Perplexity : 2.9766018720825684
Sentence: and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . ''
Perplexity : 2.850711146411766
Sentence: `` indeed , mr. collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .
Perplexity : 3.1819961746502115
Sentence: you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say .
Perplexity : 2.6338915044026816
Sentence: i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .
Perplexity : 2.832869319857803
Sentence: in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach .
Perplexity : 2.688299687169031
Sentence: this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . ''
Perplexity : 2.362829807696237
Sentence: and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr. collins thus addressed her , '' when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . ''
Perplexity : 2.81344691913813
Sentence: `` really , mr. collins , '' cried elizabeth with some warmth , `` you puzzle me exceedingly .
Perplexity : 2.610769528478236
Sentence: if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . ''
Perplexity : 2.596228606855211
Sentence: my reasons for believing it are briefly these : it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable .
Perplexity : 2.5982712291307313
Sentence: as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . ''
Perplexity : 2.5171988060626203
Sentence: `` i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .
Perplexity : 2.431357373696915
Sentence: i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .
Perplexity : 2.74599125008364
Sentence: i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .
Perplexity : 2.797053896092612
Sentence: my feelings in every respect forbid it .
Perplexity : 2.490541889765301
Sentence: can i speak plainer ?
Perplexity : 2.121400225285713
Sentence: do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . ''
Perplexity : 2.6177395966768646
Sentence: cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; `` and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . ''
Perplexity : 2.567318725641422
Sentence: to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .
Perplexity : 2.3272161866324512
Sentence: mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs. bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .
Perplexity : 2.4319508844379705
Sentence: this information , however , startled mrs. bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .
Perplexity : 2.745282787675775
Sentence: `` but depend upon it , mr. collins , '' she added , `` that lizzy shall be brought to reason .
Perplexity : 2.925651314869027
Sentence: she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will make her know it . ''
Perplexity : 3.221085385186619
Sentence: `` pardon me for interrupting you , madam , '' cried mr. collins ; `` but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .
Perplexity : 2.768818291651068
Sentence: if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . ''
Perplexity : 2.3210091105879416
Sentence: `` sir , you quite misunderstand me , '' said mrs. bennet , alarmed .
Perplexity : 2.624913686995919
Sentence: in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .
Perplexity : 2.9681692957124297
Sentence: i will go directly to mr. bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure . ''
Perplexity : 2.932565528925698
Sentence: mr. bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar .
Perplexity : 3.118934553435573
Sentence: you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . ''
Perplexity : 3.1015414378511466
Sentence: mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .
Perplexity : 2.7004667594541285
Sentence: `` i have not the pleasure of understanding you , '' said he , when she had finished her speech .
Perplexity : 2.717610230291218
Sentence: `` of what are you talking ? ''
Perplexity : 3.0300797303550855
Sentence: `` of mr. collins and lizzy .
Perplexity : 3.4511748951588492
Sentence: `` and what am i to do on the occasion ?
Perplexity : 3.5938158385750705
Sentence: it seems an hopeless business . ''
Perplexity : 2.1908033798595
Sentence: `` speak to lizzy about it yourself .
Perplexity : 2.6506206446231095
Sentence: tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . ''
Perplexity : 2.5874426599290583
Sentence: `` let her be called down .
Perplexity : 2.727288606914711
Sentence: she shall hear my opinion . ''
Perplexity : 2.487079398359251
Sentence: mrs. bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library .
Perplexity : 2.6133044157024417
Sentence: `` come here , child , '' cried her father as she appeared .
Perplexity : 2.920540078615093
Sentence: `` i have sent for you on an affair of importance .
Perplexity : 2.9304332313677515
Sentence: i understand that mr. collins has made you an offer of marriage .
Perplexity : 3.0309304126421623
Sentence: is it true ? ''
Perplexity : 2.568795146586971
Sentence: elizabeth replied that it was .
Perplexity : 4.012396664853928
Sentence: `` very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? ''
Perplexity : 2.583587266445423
Sentence: `` i have , sir . ''
Perplexity : 3.40193980100395
Sentence: `` very well .
Perplexity : 2.516869908581511
Sentence: we now come to the point .
Perplexity : 2.8845242998752214
Sentence: your mother insists upon your accepting it .
Perplexity : 1.7227707828097214
Sentence: is not it so , mrs .
Perplexity : 3.178588287390013
Sentence: bennet ? ''
Perplexity : 1.8550979775216758
Sentence: `` yes , or i will never see her again . ''
Perplexity : 3.484883058326193
Sentence: `` an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth .
Perplexity : 2.7345277653992137
Sentence: from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .
Perplexity : 2.908472933300963
Sentence: your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr. collins , and i will never see you again if you do . ''
Perplexity : 3.053439083000531
Sentence: elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs. bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .
Perplexity : 2.715744452617455
Sentence: `` what do you mean , mr. bennet , by talking in this way ?
Perplexity : 3.1153701396910174
Sentence: you promised me to insist upon her marrying him . ''
Perplexity : 2.052472327228787
Sentence: `` my dear , '' replied her husband , `` i have two small favours to request .
Perplexity : 2.6799563988775854
Sentence: first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room .
Perplexity : 3.1052859480409825
Sentence: not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs. bennet give up the point .
Perplexity : 2.94966515616198
Sentence: though her manner varied however , her determination never did .
Perplexity : 2.4921243957448165
Sentence: mr. collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .
Perplexity : 2.2913542549656642
Sentence: he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .
Perplexity : 2.7087177727484923
Sentence: his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother 's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .
Perplexity : 2.587988127439605
Sentence: she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , `` i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here !
Perplexity : 2.915786415468787
Sentence: charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where mrs. bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .
Perplexity : 2.8736289802381627
Sentence: `` pray do , my dear miss lucas , '' she added in a melancholy tone , '' for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . ''
Perplexity : 2.588608156983497
Sentence: charlotte 's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth .
Perplexity : 2.6590844638417592
Sentence: but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .
Perplexity : 2.8838128856749248
Sentence: i have done with you from this very day .
Perplexity : 3.917177810789037
Sentence: i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .

Sentence: i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .
Perplexity : 2.5802172281038143
Sentence: not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body .
Perplexity : 2.782872473555055
Sentence: nobody can tell what i suffer !
Perplexity : 2.930084144398823
Sentence: but it is always so .
Perplexity : 3.8743785222961504
Sentence: those who do not complain are never pitied . ''
Perplexity : 2.1804682520019147
Sentence: her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .
Perplexity : 2.1784424261235147
Sentence: elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr. collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .
Perplexity : 2.842616344762726
Sentence: in a doleful voice mrs. bennet thus began the projected conversation .
Perplexity : 2.056903158379241
Sentence: <s> mr .
Perplexity : 1.737919145057806
Sentence: collins ! ''
Perplexity : 2.353808179911939
Sentence: `` my dear madam , '' replied he , `` let us be for ever silent on this point .
Perplexity : 2.837508386585125
Sentence: far be it from me , '' he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , `` to resent the behaviour of your daughter .
Perplexity : 2.585728588091837
Sentence: resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned .
Perplexity : 2.6696946886586335
Sentence: perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .
Perplexity : 2.323591272395774
Sentence: you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .
Perplexity : 2.554712928905262
Sentence: my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own .
Perplexity : 2.2945101719171985
Sentence: but we are all liable to error .
Perplexity : 2.345347320021172
Sentence: i have certainly meant well through the whole affair .
Perplexity : 2.6589067899693393
Sentence: my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise . ''
Perplexity : 2.77138107861263
Sentence: the discussion of mr. collins 's offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .
Perplexity : 2.472399787390092
Sentence: as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .
Perplexity : 2.7435022963388467
Sentence: he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .
Perplexity : 2.84281038371532
Sentence: the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennet 's ill humour or ill health .
Perplexity : 2.211910578459156
Sentence: mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride .
Perplexity : 2.704503256140538
Sentence: elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .
Perplexity : 2.815001615941238
Sentence: he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay .
Perplexity : 3.079574910729001
Sentence: after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr. wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball .
Perplexity : 2.6988473980737133
Sentence: he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt 's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .
Perplexity : 2.8553696831549464
Sentence: `` i found , '' said he , `` as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr. darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . ''
Perplexity : 3.2167338057101182
Sentence: she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .
Perplexity : 2.9155845960817413
Sentence: his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .
Perplexity : 2.616100435091431
Sentence: the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady 's fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister 's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .
Perplexity : 2.4445292870607833
Sentence: jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .
Perplexity : 2.5979412773381028
Sentence: when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , '' this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .
Perplexity : 2.9730456093697017
Sentence: the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again .
Perplexity : 3.0408816258749396
Sentence: you shall hear what she says . ''
Perplexity : 2.7318826413960484
Sentence: she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr. hurst had a house .
Perplexity : 2.661467354479018
Sentence: the next was in these words .
Perplexity : 3.7137911652703974
Sentence: `` i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .
Perplexity : 2.5582933935334484
Sentence: i depend on you for that . ''
Perplexity : 3.145342343859644
Sentence: to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley 's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .
Perplexity : 2.7465766999651504
Sentence: `` it is unlucky , '' said she , after a short pause , `` that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .
Perplexity : 2.7151515715920906
Sentence: mr. bingley will not be detained in london by them . ''

Sentence: `` caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter .
Perplexity : 2.346857778351065
Sentence: i will read it to you '' when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .
Perplexity : 2.8657686124054673
Sentence: many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i despair .
Perplexity : 2.9617787567986427
Sentence: i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you . ''

Sentence: `` mr. darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .
Perplexity : 3.008187655816141
Sentence: i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .
Perplexity : 2.5464455810100235
Sentence: my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister 's partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman 's heart .
Perplexity : 2.653905980026302
Sentence: with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? ''

Sentence: `` is it not clear enough ?
Perplexity : 2.9481383389362525
Sentence: does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother 's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! )
Perplexity : 2.70767321258728
Sentence: to put me on my guard ?

Sentence: they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman 's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .
Perplexity : 2.5793304127091052
Sentence: after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .

Sentence: he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday .

Sentence: she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr. collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .
Perplexity : 2.8886591161938378
Sentence: a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .

Perplexity : 2.8632124167033597
Sentence: the possibility of mr. collins 's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , '' engaged to mr. collins !
Perplexity : 2.793499059756892
Sentence: my dear charlotte , impossible ! ''
Perplexity : 3.4366073525664405

Perplexity : 2.57078334968405
Sentence: with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , '' good lord !
Perplexity : 2.5903046213823484
Sentence: sir william , how can you tell such a story ?
Perplexity : 3.1126094552956634
Sentence: do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 3.2117323125353723
Sentence: nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william 's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .
Perplexity : 2.4703877257117552
Sentence: elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr. collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .

Perplexity : 2.7061485863016266
Sentence: mr. bennet 's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !
Perplexity : 2.962980079752788
Sentence: jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .
Perplexity : 2.798750307801773
Sentence: kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr. collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton .
Perplexity : 2.8191927959932497
Sentence: lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs. bennet 's sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .

Perplexity : 2.3941954254206665
Sentence: after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .
Perplexity : 2.6241259530258554
Sentence: mr. collins 's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet .

Sentence: neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .
Perplexity : 2.2732001989501063
Sentence: day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .

Perplexity : 2.370471810626701

Perplexity : 2.542940996072219

Sentence: he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .
Perplexity : 2.3225572929430367
Sentence: every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .
Perplexity : 2.650388080279957
Sentence: at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .

Sentence: elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister 's ready acquiescence .
Perplexity : 2.8046255577525754
Sentence: `` i hope , '' added mrs. gardiner , `` that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .
Perplexity : 2.9649049374168803
Sentence: we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . ''
Perplexity : 3.058556085087154
Sentence: `` and that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr. darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london !
Perplexity : 3.2767991674900525
Sentence: mr. darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month 's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , mr. bingley never stirs without him . ''

Sentence: i hope they will not meet at all .

Sentence: `` she will drop the acquaintance entirely . ''
Perplexity : 2.357352063622221
Sentence: but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley 's being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .
Perplexity : 2.7497195236735057
Sentence: it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane 's attractions .
Perplexity : 2.7897202958237393
Sentence: miss bennet accepted her aunt 's invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline 's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .

Perplexity : 2.76462634631983
Sentence: without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .
Perplexity : 3.0565816856622043
Sentence: to mrs. gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .
Perplexity : 2.5226364010573175
Sentence: about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged .
Perplexity : 2.8125006660136482
Sentence: they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy 's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring .

Sentence: on being made acquainted with the present mr. darcy 's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman 's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy .
Perplexity : 2.555622456995958
Sentence: mrs. gardiner 's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : '' you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly .

Sentence: seriously , i would have you be on your guard .
Perplexity : 3.8934812533465863

Perplexity : 2.654444264375321

Sentence: the room in which the ladies sat was backwards .
Perplexity : 3.157467525256572
Sentence: elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement .
Perplexity : 2.8735633565481224
Sentence: she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .

Sentence: very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .

Sentence: she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collins 's joints of meat were too large for her family .
Perplexity : 2.3407741251860084
Sentence: the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .

Perplexity : 2.908695843860278
Sentence: elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr. darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley 's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself .
Perplexity : 2.8561391557638394
Sentence: his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr. collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence .

Sentence: colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs. collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body .

Sentence: have you never happened to see her there ? ''
Perplexity : 3.0723378292634718

Perplexity : 2.758126949572212
Sentence: it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen 's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .

Perplexity : 2.8841145971888467
Sentence: her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .
Perplexity : 2.826953425831433

Sentence: i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .
Perplexity : 2.776494993412844
Sentence: indeed , mr. darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . ''
Perplexity : 2.735305670471062
Sentence: `` pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , '' cried colonel fitzwilliam .
Perplexity : 3.1222292020796423

Perplexity : 2.8817483371227044
Sentence: it is because he will not give himself the trouble . ''
Perplexity : 3.3920203234178263

Perplexity : 2.648705877355999
Sentence: but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising .
Perplexity : 2.768660879831703

Perplexity : 2.728426787947754
Sentence: you have employed your time much better .
Perplexity : 2.467046951675761
Sentence: we neither of us perform to strangers . ''
Perplexity : 1.8011433187353612
Sentence: here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .
Perplexity : 2.8758091022290055
Sentence: lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy , '' miss bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master .
Perplexity : 2.994270175126147
Sentence: she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne 's .
Perplexity : 2.6493431660969526
Sentence: anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . ''
Perplexity : 2.568276117256698
Sentence: elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin 's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .
Perplexity : 2.8599949253033325
Sentence: lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth 's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .
Perplexity : 2.236409274827784
Sentence: elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship 's carriage was ready to take them all home .
Perplexity : 2.821641473717156
Sentence: as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr. darcy , and mr. darcy only , entered the room .
Perplexity : 2.8879964817509713
Sentence: they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .
Perplexity : 2.483884568498374
Sentence: it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , '' how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 2.7762086922455347
Sentence: it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before .
Perplexity : 3.310989179767135
Sentence: he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london . ''
Perplexity : 3.2833774929786377
Sentence: she found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , '' i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ? ''
Perplexity : 3.0591965660814826
Sentence: `` i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .
Perplexity : 3.053937675417968
Sentence: he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . ''
Perplexity : 2.8215125751566434
Sentence: `` if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .
Perplexity : 3.059577577882701
Sentence: but perhaps mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . ''
Perplexity : 3.021208118377718
Sentence: `` i should not be surprised , '' said darcy , `` if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . ''
Perplexity : 3.0193745853772422
Sentence: she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .
Perplexity : 3.104063272460636
Sentence: he took the hint , and soon began with , `` this seems a very comfortable house .
Perplexity : 2.796690186084005
Sentence: lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr. collins first came to hunsford . ''
Perplexity : 3.1181750960698613
Sentence: `` i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . ''
Perplexity : 2.7887660124309392
Sentence: `` yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .
Perplexity : 3.121013935603534
Sentence: my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did .
Perplexity : 2.6818864654487635
Sentence: she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . ''
Perplexity : 2.694743234833486
Sentence: `` it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . ''
Perplexity : 2.986884579653993
Sentence: `` an easy distance do you call it ?
Perplexity : 2.5951646912033333
Sentence: it is nearly fifty miles . ''
Perplexity : 2.1849132892069725
Sentence: `` and what is fifty miles of good road ?
Perplexity : 2.9634042240799054
Sentence: little more than half a day 's journey .
Perplexity : 3.072339667123826
Sentence: yes , i call it a very easy distance . ''
Perplexity : 3.013396672512285
Sentence: `` i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , '' cried elizabeth .
Perplexity : 2.6913514652598614
Sentence: `` i should never have said mrs. collins was settled near her family . ''
Perplexity : 3.3565363144903104
Sentence: `` it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire .
Perplexity : 2.764779401271226
Sentence: any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far . ''
Perplexity : 2.8889676689245314
Sentence: as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , '' i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .
Perplexity : 2.9987216722836916
Sentence: the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .
Perplexity : 2.307283134734834
Sentence: where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .
Perplexity : 2.1654258572933776
Sentence: mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . ''
Perplexity : 2.6392252520801396
Sentence: mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , `` you can not have a right to such very strong local attachment .
Perplexity : 3.087290115297846
Sentence: you can not have been always at longbourn . ''
Perplexity : 3.269935994890586
Sentence: elizabeth looked surprised .
Perplexity : 3.041936761666665
Sentence: the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , '' are you pleased with kent ? ''
Perplexity : 2.67980810423869
Sentence: a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .
Perplexity : 2.376939361452041
Sentence: the tte  tte surprised them .
Perplexity : 1.764988176961914
Sentence: mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .
Perplexity : 2.5631310747302702
Sentence: `` what can be the meaning of this ! ''
Perplexity : 3.6375937506036795
Sentence: said charlotte , as soon as he was gone .
Perplexity : 3.1868641400541464
Sentence: `` my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . ''
Perplexity : 2.8486675915356607
Sentence: but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte 's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .
Perplexity : 3.142765366009551
Sentence: all field sports were over .
Perplexity : 1.8215952679421572
Sentence: within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen can not be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .
Perplexity : 2.8162844489537577
Sentence: they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .
Perplexity : 2.5273585055368053
Sentence: it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam 's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .
Perplexity : 2.986754737156131
Sentence: but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .

Perplexity : 2.5927053038455123
Sentence: he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collins 's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too .

Sentence: younger sons can not marry where they like . ''

Sentence: does your charge give you much trouble ?
Perplexity : 2.444319967310857

Sentence: from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .
Perplexity : 2.963247078871403

Sentence: `` what is it you mean ? ''
Perplexity : 3.316140539333668

Sentence: `` you may depend upon my not mentioning it . ''
Perplexity : 2.525805654533814
Sentence: what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . ''
Perplexity : 2.7362385021346087
Sentence: `` did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? ''

Perplexity : 3.3459171655272795

Sentence: `` you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? ''
Perplexity : 2.446699654515937
Sentence: `` but , '' she continued , recollecting herself , `` as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .
Perplexity : 3.0418862017614297
Sentence: it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . ''
Perplexity : 3.052488027342423
Sentence: `` that is not an unnatural surmise , '' said fitzwilliam , `` but it is lessening the honour of my cousin 's triumph very sadly . ''
Perplexity : 2.5069841526732946
Sentence: there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .
Perplexity : 2.9249660547158878
Sentence: it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .
Perplexity : 2.995322757487958
Sentence: there could not exist in the world two men , over whom mr. darcy could have such boundless influence .
Perplexity : 2.5802122724300722
Sentence: that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr. bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .
Perplexity : 2.738366061764006
Sentence: if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .
Perplexity : 2.8338981776188237
Sentence: he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .
Perplexity : 2.5905628311338638
Sentence: `` there were some very strong objections against the lady , '' were colonel fitzwilliam 's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london .
Perplexity : 2.932472465354718
Sentence: `` to jane herself , '' she exclaimed , `` there could be no possibility of objection .

Sentence: all loveliness and goodness as she is !

Sentence: her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .
Perplexity : 2.4568640492948415
Sentence: neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . ''
Perplexity : 2.5247868394555013
Sentence: when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr. darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend 's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister .
Perplexity : 2.8204542773167645
Sentence: the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .
Perplexity : 2.6323778938405127
Sentence: mrs. collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr. collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine 's being rather displeased by her staying at home .
Perplexity : 2.825526290573198
Sentence: when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent .
Perplexity : 2.8293974807784035
Sentence: they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .
Perplexity : 2.0135283428960467
Sentence: but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .
Perplexity : 2.7325724612891853
Sentence: elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .
Perplexity : 2.477093165989602
Sentence: mr. darcy 's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister 's sufferings .
Perplexity : 2.2836633934254653
Sentence: it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .
Perplexity : 2.994940712468284
Sentence: she could not think of darcy 's leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .
Perplexity : 3.0772204709935647
Sentence: while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .
Perplexity : 2.571581166703261
Sentence: but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr. darcy walk into the room .
Perplexity : 2.8966593573555106
Sentence: in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .
Perplexity : 2.6099877557578424
Sentence: she answered him with cold civility .
Perplexity : 2.6276270948556575
Sentence: he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .
Perplexity : 2.3947957971966995
Sentence: elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .
Perplexity : 3.23531700647375
Sentence: after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , '' in vain have i struggled .
Perplexity : 2.8722044587827384
Sentence: my feelings will not be repressed .
Perplexity : 2.5671652074622964
Sentence: you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you . ''
Perplexity : 2.3282563721042915
Sentence: elizabeth 's astonishment was beyond expression .
Perplexity : 2.5084814929308026
Sentence: she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .
Perplexity : 2.2502099913914297
Sentence: this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .
Perplexity : 2.8506419468857636
Sentence: he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .
Perplexity : 2.802855651557218
Sentence: his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .
Perplexity : 2.32390446647115
Sentence: she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .
Perplexity : 2.839641562042771
Sentence: he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .
Perplexity : 2.528079536219678
Sentence: as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .
Perplexity : 3.1814443482567873
Sentence: such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , '' in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .
Perplexity : 2.6373191523083843
Sentence: it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you .
Perplexity : 3.1357076923150524
Sentence: but i can not i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .
Perplexity : 3.0053652299436933
Sentence: i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .
Perplexity : 2.8631791341578277
Sentence: it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration .
Perplexity : 2.904480814823993
Sentence: the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . ''
Perplexity : 2.7166240953269756
Sentence: mr. darcy , who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .
Perplexity : 2.3780994192901725
Sentence: his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .
Perplexity : 2.1386610369803765
Sentence: he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .
Perplexity : 2.454450082280638
Sentence: the pause was to elizabeth 's feelings dreadful .
Perplexity : 2.878735529674438
Sentence: at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , '' and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !
Perplexity : 3.2879471165899883
Sentence: i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected .
Perplexity : 2.783431592437046
Sentence: but it is of small importance . ''
Perplexity : 2.9461756591097092
Sentence: `` i might as well enquire , '' replied she , `` why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?
Perplexity : 2.8308474949237445
Sentence: but i have other provocations .
Perplexity : 3.2446644859949862
Sentence: you know i have .
Perplexity : 8.171130369799025
Sentence: as she pronounced these words , mr. darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .
Perplexity : 2.5329905230134777
Sentence: no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .
Perplexity : 1.7117803552802215
Sentence: she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .
Perplexity : 2.3111470883488825
Sentence: he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .
Perplexity : 2.484348901227704
Sentence: `` can you deny that you have done it ? ''
Perplexity : 3.0312113516461383
Sentence: towards him i have been kinder than towards myself . ''
Perplexity : 2.2256442842752704
Sentence: elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .
Perplexity : 2.180121107417699
Sentence: `` but it is not merely this affair , '' she continued , `` on which my dislike is founded .
Perplexity : 2.939925955170037
Sentence: your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 2.5227848162562694
Sentence: on this subject , what can you have to say ?
Perplexity : 4.29863416964597
Sentence: in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?
Perplexity : 2.1812735764571096

Sentence: `` you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .
Perplexity : 2.409530201199671

Perplexity : 2.8495793689249918
Sentence: you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .
Perplexity : 2.8552886246318643
Sentence: you have done all this !
Perplexity : 4.140605925786952
Sentence: and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . ''
Perplexity : 2.1374018237089296
Sentence: this is the estimation in which you hold me !
Perplexity : 2.7667026834293744
Sentence: i thank you for explaining it so fully .
Perplexity : 2.249952118488755
Sentence: these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing .

Sentence: but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .

Sentence: `` from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry .

Sentence: it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .
Perplexity : 2.1263497110849685
Sentence: but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr. wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .

Sentence: if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your 's , i can only say that i am sorry .

Perplexity : 2.8463151684727155
Sentence: my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .

Sentence: but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .
Perplexity : 2.5992040525157227

Perplexity : 2.522397220692828
Sentence: to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .
Perplexity : 2.8684734959447464

Perplexity : 2.7541875383461605
Sentence: there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town .
Perplexity : 2.8552247028826345

Sentence: mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .
Perplexity : 2.798973998095628
Sentence: my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education .
Perplexity : 2.6195550117875186
Sentence: my father was not only fond of this young man 's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .
Perplexity : 2.995545140522653
Sentence: as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner .
Perplexity : 3.3683997057881596
Sentence: the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr. darcy could not have .
Perplexity : 2.5791808264457696
Sentence: here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell .

Perplexity : 2.5935719223849434
Sentence: he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .
Perplexity : 2.9425164781498725
Sentence: i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .
Perplexity : 2.640334805933617

Perplexity : 2.7075984467240417
Sentence: in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .
Perplexity : 2.681517866688562
Sentence: for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .

Sentence: his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .
Perplexity : 3.062846082338345
Sentence: he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions .
Perplexity : 2.912499798672865
Sentence: you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .
Perplexity : 2.3110289298165583
Sentence: his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .
Perplexity : 2.6229518448278304
Sentence: after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .
Perplexity : 2.4612019436888626
Sentence: how he lived i know not .
Perplexity : 2.894980694002481
Sentence: but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
Perplexity : 2.342258875822532
Sentence: i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .
Perplexity : 2.7936874940151797
Sentence: my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .
Perplexity : 2.89629154838188
Sentence: about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .
Perplexity : 2.783324982380472
Sentence: she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .
Perplexity : 3.026959395680666
Sentence: i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .
Perplexity : 2.4865943181871017
Sentence: you may imagine what i felt and how i acted .
Perplexity : 3.3221690313167858
Sentence: regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge .
Perplexity : 2.689804748480445
Sentence: mr. wickham 's chief object was unquestionably my sister 's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .
Perplexity : 2.73617059042385
Sentence: his revenge would have been complete indeed .
Perplexity : 2.129370945647655
Sentence: this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 2.628666571140043
Sentence: i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .
Perplexity : 2.8967514490176476
Sentence: ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .
Perplexity : 2.6595456125585724
Sentence: you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .
Perplexity : 2.9199859054635007
Sentence: but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .
Perplexity : 2.9775020891823
Sentence: for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .
Perplexity : 2.487498601489528
Sentence: i will only add , god bless you .
Perplexity : 2.2714435497184136
Sentence: `` fitzwilliam darcy . ''
Perplexity : 2.106605979769592
Sentence: if elizabeth , when mr. darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .
Perplexity : 2.772278913075573
Sentence: but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .
Perplexity : 2.771690758534456
Sentence: her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .
Perplexity : 2.71473568127189
Sentence: with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .
Perplexity : 2.8968591599017754
Sentence: with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield .
Perplexity : 3.0460563042668833
Sentence: his belief of her sister 's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .
Perplexity : 2.7973156084134922
Sentence: he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .
Perplexity : 2.3403432567225906
Sentence: it was all pride and insolence .
Perplexity : 2.961128037020397
Sentence: but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .
Perplexity : 2.582555199648264
Sentence: astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .
Perplexity : 2.1952546335926213
Sentence: she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , `` this must be false !
Perplexity : 2.6133705885179657
Sentence: this must be the grossest falsehood ! ''
Perplexity : 2.2943441896236263
Sentence: and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .
Perplexity : 2.994019117535238
Sentence: the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .
Perplexity : 2.826606499685991
Sentence: so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .
Perplexity : 3.053744597808323
Sentence: but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham 's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .
Perplexity : 2.359118852301781
Sentence: on both sides it was only assertion .
Perplexity : 2.195050180825371
Sentence: again she read on .
Perplexity : 2.650640597640832
Sentence: but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr. darcy 's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .
Perplexity : 2.6556621757700545
Sentence: of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself .
Perplexity : 3.285803130482546
Sentence: as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .
Perplexity : 3.2292145052701784
Sentence: his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .
Perplexity : 3.0281828095493677
Sentence: she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .
Perplexity : 2.280923541723014
Sentence: but no such recollection befriended her .
Perplexity : 2.275694506087936
Sentence: she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .
Perplexity : 2.6291903735283917
Sentence: the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin 's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .
Perplexity : 2.696730640340357

Sentence: their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; mrs. bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases ; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person 's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her .

Perplexity : 2.5739102665191043
Sentence: to this , mary very gravely replied , `` far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .
Perplexity : 2.594904269223057
Sentence: they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .
Perplexity : 1.7428421149458775
Sentence: but i confess they would have no charms for me .
Perplexity : 2.8004528373491193
Sentence: i should infinitely prefer a book . ''
Perplexity : 1.9929255879629766
Sentence: but of this answer lydia heard not a word .
Perplexity : 2.6191864973564307
Sentence: she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all .
Perplexity : 2.7583771856623436

Perplexity : 2.5544809168440845

Perplexity : 2.977197722668613
Sentence: elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .
Perplexity : 2.5699550312507196
Sentence: elizabeth 's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr. darcy and herself .
Perplexity : 2.7185734750725867
Sentence: miss bennet 's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .
Perplexity : 2.5424338935270976
Sentence: she was sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister 's refusal must have given him .
Perplexity : 2.6487596024243625
Sentence: `` his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , '' said she ; `` and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . ''
Perplexity : 2.8381369610435465
Sentence: `` indeed , '' replied elizabeth , `` i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .

Sentence: you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? ''
Perplexity : 2.5541557427606563

Perplexity : 1.7290958975678898
Sentence: oh , no . ''
Perplexity : 3.621446322116782
Sentence: `` but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham . ''
Perplexity : 2.6489537622075194
Sentence: `` no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . ''
Perplexity : 3.0633312113659636
Sentence: `` but you will know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day . ''
Perplexity : 3.4260217477225825
Sentence: she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham .
Perplexity : 2.6317901483944146
Sentence: who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .
Perplexity : 2.111449610379858
Sentence: nor was darcy 's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .
Perplexity : 2.4564100181626207
Sentence: most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .
Perplexity : 2.0296728222809537
Sentence: `` this will not do , '' said elizabeth .
Perplexity : 3.6644361020065976
Sentence: `` you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .
Perplexity : 3.202616565747476
Sentence: take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .
Perplexity : 3.2328232693406616
Sentence: there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .
Perplexity : 2.6691078316501704
Sentence: for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr. darcy 's , but you shall do as you chuse . ''
Perplexity : 3.1681508918261407
Sentence: it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane .
Perplexity : 2.9180665411192117
Sentence: `` i do not know when i have been more shocked , '' said she .
Perplexity : 3.0710223383288087
Sentence: `` wickham so very bad !
Perplexity : 2.642266764140196
Sentence: it is almost past belief .
Perplexity : 2.7189989693151815
Sentence: dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .
Perplexity : 2.9623082422562197
Sentence: such a disappointment !
Perplexity : 3.3255059479132445
Sentence: and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !
Perplexity : 2.9074605487584027
Sentence: and having to relate such a thing of his sister !
Perplexity : 3.534485989987432
Sentence: it is really too distressing .
Perplexity : 2.851651039073849
Sentence: i am sure you must feel it so . ''
Perplexity : 3.24399688776319
Sentence: no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .
Perplexity : 2.9116614042700917
Sentence: i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .
Perplexity : 2.366998471401674
Sentence: your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . ''
Perplexity : 2.3603925512149964
Sentence: `` poor wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !
Perplexity : 2.903353543312743
Sentence: such an openness and gentleness in his manner . ''
Perplexity : 2.3434245443559116
Sentence: `` there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .
Perplexity : 2.4982737270682667
Sentence: one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . ''
Perplexity : 2.884054502511709
Sentence: `` i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . ''
Perplexity : 3.394460298289575
Sentence: `` and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .
Perplexity : 2.575419555444415
Sentence: one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . ''
Perplexity : 2.4558877666645
Sentence: `` lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . ''
Perplexity : 2.758769313843659
Sentence: `` indeed i could not .
Perplexity : 4.45540712685412
Sentence: i was uncomfortable enough .
Perplexity : 2.39567465971463
Sentence: i was very uncomfortable , i may say unhappy .
Perplexity : 2.9802724857436256
Sentence: how i wanted you ! ''
Perplexity : 2.5186542639427207
Sentence: `` how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved . ''
Perplexity : 2.487028598898688
Sentence: but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging .
Perplexity : 2.4610089909262984
Sentence: there is one point , on which i want your advice .
Perplexity : 3.4094121990164403
Sentence: miss bennet paused a little and then replied , `` surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .
Perplexity : 2.384796458227989
Sentence: what is your own opinion ? ''
Perplexity : 3.427619415017334
Sentence: `` that it ought not to be attempted .
Perplexity : 3.0614546000178935
Sentence: mr. darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .
Perplexity : 2.7734345450675937
Sentence: on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?
Perplexity : 2.839860019854616
Sentence: the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .
Perplexity : 3.0227838279389596
Sentence: i am not equal to it .
Perplexity : 3.59185221838142
Sentence: wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .
Perplexity : 2.8673586556642015
Sentence: sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .
Perplexity : 2.5576243635098876
Sentence: at present i will say nothing about it . ''
Perplexity : 2.9046414687389928
Sentence: `` you are quite right .
Perplexity : 2.9927579494294596
Sentence: he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character .
Perplexity : 2.7283133107183954
Sentence: we must not make him desperate . ''
Perplexity : 2.5254822391216583
Sentence: the tumult of elizabeth 's mind was allayed by this conversation .
Perplexity : 2.3937623050371757
Sentence: she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .
Perplexity : 2.7039370490072585
Sentence: but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .
Perplexity : 2.1645593666912144
Sentence: she dared not relate the other half of mr. darcy 's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .
Perplexity : 2.59529602783836
Sentence: here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .
Perplexity : 2.323698229301038
Sentence: `` and then , '' said she , `` if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .
Perplexity : 2.754587257016913
Sentence: the liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value ! ''
Perplexity : 2.3934535831880996
Sentence: jane was not happy .
Perplexity : 4.259901333343076
Sentence: she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .
Perplexity : 2.340151113713577
Sentence: `` well , lizzy , '' said mrs. bennet one day , `` what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane 's ?
Perplexity : 3.0495770892459744
Sentence: for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .
Perplexity : 3.0099418710164443
Sentence: but i can not find out that jane saw any thing of him in london .
Perplexity : 3.1979802450673396
Sentence: `` i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more . ''
Perplexity : 3.105019436887602
Sentence: `` oh , well !
Perplexity : 3.7005826643860336
Sentence: it is just as he chooses .
Perplexity : 2.778115509606113
Sentence: nobody wants him to come .
Perplexity : 2.953074496229899
Sentence: though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .
Perplexity : 3.3224867343127458
Sentence: well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . ''
Perplexity : 2.9050584572500497
Sentence: but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .
Perplexity : 2.8575003847018685
Sentence: `` well , lizzy , '' continued her mother soon afterwards , `` and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ?
Perplexity : 3.0831184952166977
Sentence: well , well , i only hope it will last .
Perplexity : 3.562572863873276
Sentence: charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say .
Perplexity : 2.140218288587795
Sentence: if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .
Perplexity : 2.7310787128789387
Sentence: there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , i dare say . ''
Perplexity : 2.4289898044857745
Sentence: `` no , nothing at all . ''
Perplexity : 2.938403650306751
Sentence: `` a great deal of good management , depend upon it .

Sentence: `` it was a subject which they could not mention before me . ''
Perplexity : 3.1783851501550213
Sentence: `` no .
Perplexity : 8.237864960646306
Sentence: it would have been strange if they had .
Perplexity : 3.0961204288200816
Sentence: but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .
Perplexity : 3.3307546761559723
Sentence: well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .
Perplexity : 3.1782572175128188
Sentence: i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . ''
Perplexity : 2.7335112016284877
Sentence: the first week of their return was soon gone .

Sentence: i thought i should have broke my heart . ''
Perplexity : 2.65400749077408
Sentence: `` i am sure i shall break mine , '' said lydia .
Perplexity : 2.480745214683191
Sentence: `` if one could but go to brighton ! ''

Perplexity : 2.500937096822521

Perplexity : 2.762485356639169
Sentence: i only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .
Perplexity : 2.5578943914873484

Sentence: she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .
Perplexity : 2.5043412374046223
Sentence: but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .

Sentence: her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .

Sentence: those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs. forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .

Perplexity : 2.5767633434142136
Sentence: she related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain .
Perplexity : 2.361978537579766
Sentence: mr. gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase .

Sentence: `` he is the best landlord , and the best master , '' said she , `` that ever lived .

Perplexity : 3.1320611247050136
Sentence: some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it .
Perplexity : 2.6689848593844725
Sentence: to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . ''
Perplexity : 2.66270783868543
Sentence: `` in what an amiable light does this place him ! ''
Perplexity : 2.7927354182166395
Sentence: thought elizabeth .
Perplexity : 3.444505698039702

Perplexity : 2.8984272094772217

Perplexity : 2.9124969821379447

Sentence: the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed rooms , were all that remained to be shewn .
Perplexity : 2.630087031893451
Sentence: in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy 's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .
Perplexity : 2.562098978844067
Sentence: in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .
Perplexity : 2.8197466038624315
Sentence: she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .
Perplexity : 2.651283774929883
Sentence: mrs. reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father 's life time .
Perplexity : 3.07067929759269
Sentence: there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth 's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .
Perplexity : 3.0381536517525567
Sentence: what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?
Perplexity : 2.3397900161967438
Sentence: as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people 's happiness were in his guardianship !
Perplexity : 3.085076915673952
Sentence: how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow !
Perplexity : 3.484995356687054
Sentence: every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .
Perplexity : 2.5724532075576194
Sentence: when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .
Perplexity : 2.5757294130649786
Sentence: as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .
Perplexity : 2.416301618486562
Sentence: their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .
Perplexity : 2.1823198066640535
Sentence: he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .
Perplexity : 2.7289647369067187
Sentence: she had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .
Perplexity : 2.4896533065016055
Sentence: amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .
Perplexity : 2.817818450944525
Sentence: nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .
Perplexity : 2.9950337346020155
Sentence: the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .
Perplexity : 3.0184576309167306
Sentence: she was overpowered by shame and vexation .
Perplexity : 1.8343892536648625
Sentence: how strange must it appear to him !
Perplexity : 3.098276008553287
Sentence: in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !
Perplexity : 2.251102899950084
Sentence: it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !
Perplexity : 2.854585340815914
Sentence: why did she come ?
Perplexity : 3.6251834488167876
Sentence: or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?
Perplexity : 3.2168444470053945
Sentence: had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .
Perplexity : 2.626299049646085
Sentence: she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .
Perplexity : 2.4045345692366467
Sentence: that he should even speak to her was amazing !
Perplexity : 3.332443460080295
Sentence: but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !
Perplexity : 3.220982066709444
Sentence: never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .
Perplexity : 2.5945881545171727
Sentence: they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .
Perplexity : 2.72322256391462
Sentence: her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr. darcy then was .
Perplexity : 3.0293537576012977
Sentence: she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .
Perplexity : 3.01389845418968
Sentence: whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .
Perplexity : 3.2778906888626382
Sentence: at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .
Perplexity : 2.5787032156545577
Sentence: they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .
Perplexity : 2.196806635074796
Sentence: mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .
Perplexity : 2.742715153476821
Sentence: with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .
Perplexity : 2.869376364147686
Sentence: it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .
Perplexity : 2.470661103436632
Sentence: they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it .
Perplexity : 2.2057044155028467
Sentence: elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .
Perplexity : 2.5218320632809106
Sentence: her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .
Perplexity : 2.653074272890151
Sentence: whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth 's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .
Perplexity : 3.056196429602102
Sentence: the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .
Perplexity : 2.852202444482528
Sentence: elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .
Perplexity : 2.7715954794920035
Sentence: for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .
Perplexity : 2.6091874120793666
Sentence: this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .
Perplexity : 2.4274196048426573
Sentence: her colour changed , and she said no more .
Perplexity : 3.116793457203694
Sentence: mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .
Perplexity : 3.0046549422423787
Sentence: this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .
Perplexity : 2.752418425124496
Sentence: `` what will be his surprise , '' thought she , `` when he knows who they are !
Perplexity : 3.7286945315434736
Sentence: the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .
Perplexity : 2.646003799709205
Sentence: that he was surprised by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr. gardiner .
Perplexity : 2.7292695026146707
Sentence: it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .
Perplexity : 2.6636329318453935
Sentence: she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .
Perplexity : 2.679720269625336
Sentence: the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .
Perplexity : 2.461367101012649
Sentence: mrs. gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .
Perplexity : 2.593696563388445
Sentence: her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , `` why is he so altered ?
Perplexity : 2.4879608138617
Sentence: from what can it proceed ?
Perplexity : 3.324667672627378
Sentence: it can not be for me , it can not be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .
Perplexity : 3.3503002608574306
Sentence: my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .
Perplexity : 2.628120650358451
Sentence: it is impossible that he should still love me . ''
Perplexity : 2.7264214949381707
Sentence: after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .
Perplexity : 2.3580565638170023
Sentence: it originated in mrs. gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth 's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband 's .
Perplexity : 2.398904441912879
Sentence: he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .
Perplexity : 2.6552850056572965
Sentence: `` they will join me early to morrow , '' he continued , `` and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , mr. bingley and his sisters . ''
Perplexity : 2.6940858126786984
Sentence: elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .
Perplexity : 2.059719088996466
Sentence: her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingley 's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .
Perplexity : 2.9902316992275657
Sentence: `` there is also one other person in the party , '' he continued after a pause , `` who more particularly wishes to be known to you , will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? ''
Perplexity : 3.0452546755320093
Sentence: the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .
Perplexity : 2.9678623598532137
Sentence: she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .
Perplexity : 3.0712668285266043
Sentence: they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought .
Perplexity : 2.536364750860457
Sentence: elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .

Sentence: she certainly did not hate him .

Perplexity : 2.4368602688218153

Sentence: it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy 's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .

Perplexity : 2.4913907721722732
Sentence: it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .
Perplexity : 2.581361172217685
Sentence: elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .
Perplexity : 2.8797781654169836
Sentence: this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .

Sentence: her own thoughts were employing her .

Perplexity : 2.6852874981325217
Sentence: the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .
Perplexity : 2.362623294003783
Sentence: there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .
Perplexity : 2.5308475992964734
Sentence: while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .
Perplexity : 2.89162708106044
Sentence: he had been some time with mr. gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .
Perplexity : 2.985051525511083
Sentence: no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .
Perplexity : 2.7217275624316315
Sentence: in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley 's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over .
Perplexity : 2.615434836212514
Sentence: miss darcy , on her brother 's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .
Perplexity : 2.8992693754936893
Sentence: miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , '' pray , miss eliza , are not the shire militia removed from meryton ?

Sentence: they must be a great loss to your family . ''
Perplexity : 3.3660816817845776
Sentence: in darcy 's presence she dared not mention wickham 's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment 's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .
Perplexity : 2.352519413882776
Sentence: while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .
Perplexity : 2.4310551605325457
Sentence: had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy 's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .
Perplexity : 2.6404028097687204
Sentence: not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy 's meditated elopement .
Perplexity : 2.4892318179467576

Perplexity : 2.777035822276479
Sentence: he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .
Perplexity : 2.7371520992798457
Sentence: elizabeth 's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .
Perplexity : 2.4697734371111415
Sentence: her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .
Perplexity : 2.7491720883893795
Sentence: their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress .
Perplexity : 2.63919971276272
Sentence: but georgiana would not join her .
Perplexity : 2.2285390545943327
Sentence: her brother 's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .
Perplexity : 2.4642196597454746
Sentence: when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .

Sentence: as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .
Perplexity : 2.473909162933587
Sentence: if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth 's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .
Perplexity : 2.3725815004278172
Sentence: but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .
Perplexity : 2.436088049021407
Sentence: be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia 's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .
Perplexity : 2.544678322989758
Sentence: no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .

Sentence: surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement .
Perplexity : 2.948757150239335
Sentence: while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .
Perplexity : 2.7943788854373777
Sentence: for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .
Perplexity : 2.469594567910176
Sentence: she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .

Perplexity : 2.7785531616954118
Sentence: mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant 's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .
Perplexity : 2.31970483007391
Sentence: though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be deeply affected .

Perplexity : 2.9948016853759225
Sentence: `` and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth !

Sentence: oh , that i knew how it was ! ''
Perplexity : 3.793689449186909
Sentence: but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .
Perplexity : 2.2278679867030418

Sentence: `` i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , '' said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; `` and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .
Perplexity : 2.9928639862892434
Sentence: it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel 's family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best .

Perplexity : 2.994730554317014
Sentence: i can not think so very ill of wickham .
Perplexity : 3.5727989267529985

Perplexity : 3.240884069446987
Sentence: `` not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .

Perplexity : 3.2268707013555806
Sentence: `` in the first place , '' replied mr. gardiner , `` there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland . ''
Perplexity : 2.775159982070109
Sentence: but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !
Perplexity : 2.1070104000145613

Perplexity : 2.9663134866999776
Sentence: though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .

Sentence: elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .

Perplexity : 3.013922727580474

Perplexity : 3.425358537439478
Sentence: she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .

Perplexity : 2.887262438703317
Sentence: i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted .
Perplexity : 3.072237962285735

Perplexity : 2.87379739764002

Perplexity : 3.2716477782126008
Sentence: well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .

Sentence: `` mr .
Perplexity : 1.737919145057806

Perplexity : 2.743535408828962
Sentence: `` oh , yes !
Perplexity : 2.2077099266231532
Sentence: he was to come there with wickham , you know .
Perplexity : 3.7987961582597727
Sentence: but gracious me !
Perplexity : 1.7333170271252563
Sentence: i quite forgot !
Perplexity : 1.901737578580617
Sentence: i ought not to have said a word about it .
Perplexity : 3.2956208456323606
Sentence: i promised them so faithfully !
Perplexity : 1.676833952639743

Perplexity : 2.2890557304191934
Sentence: `` thank you , '' said lydia , `` for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry . ''
Perplexity : 3.1944723821431107
Sentence: mr. darcy had been at her sister 's wedding .
Perplexity : 3.792867503765217
Sentence: conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .
Perplexity : 2.4752416333260925
Sentence: those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .
Perplexity : 2.1100937328236675
Sentence: `` you may readily comprehend , '' she added , `` what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .
Perplexity : 2.9463826940620983
Sentence: pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . ''
Perplexity : 2.6222130726514687
Sentence: jane 's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .
Perplexity : 2.669541897074315
Sentence: elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .
Perplexity : 3.126939764137763
Sentence: she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .
Perplexity : 2.813038041202624
Sentence: `` gracechurch street , sept. 6 .
Perplexity : 1.6126112084656288

Perplexity : 2.621719763979249
Sentence: i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from you .
Perplexity : 2.868211392785505
Sentence: do n't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .
Perplexity : 2.7850641434906325
Sentence: if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .
Perplexity : 2.3700941349223954

Perplexity : 2.9362037658130515
Sentence: he came to tell mr. gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once .
Perplexity : 3.204638462302032
Sentence: from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .
Perplexity : 2.7635336074761994
Sentence: the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .
Perplexity : 2.8720697701217053
Sentence: he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .
Perplexity : 2.428754014857868
Sentence: he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .
Perplexity : 2.6272110096528762
Sentence: if he had another motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him .
Perplexity : 2.8521575541316335
Sentence: he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .
Perplexity : 3.0298015166615597
Sentence: there is a lady , it seems , a mrs. younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .
Perplexity : 2.9598520675629247
Sentence: she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .
Perplexity : 2.265092775983312
Sentence: this mrs. younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .
Perplexity : 3.226369101219366
Sentence: but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .
Perplexity : 3.363408525138306
Sentence: she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .
Perplexity : 2.510772711469878
Sentence: wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .
Perplexity : 3.154641749547487
Sentence: at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction .
Perplexity : 2.1925561039712522
Sentence: they were in street .
Perplexity : 4.18661235089207
Sentence: he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .
Perplexity : 2.165380025786333
Sentence: his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .
Perplexity : 2.885505906074455
Sentence: but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .
Perplexity : 2.697487829462007
Sentence: she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham .
Perplexity : 2.9925112676961696
Sentence: she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .
Perplexity : 3.244806281142124
Sentence: since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .
Perplexity : 3.177221320221241
Sentence: he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia 's flight , on her own folly alone .
Perplexity : 2.5677568792285217
Sentence: he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .
Perplexity : 2.6776643117474057
Sentence: he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .
Perplexity : 3.303145268243925
Sentence: mr. darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .
Perplexity : 3.1297838591770124
Sentence: though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .
Perplexity : 3.037120286950377
Sentence: but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .
Perplexity : 2.977501488583199
Sentence: under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .
Perplexity : 2.411649393626377
Sentence: wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .
Perplexity : 2.9575599890752153
Sentence: every thing being settled between them , mr. darcy 's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home .
Perplexity : 3.1675657498319736
Sentence: he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .
Perplexity : 2.894187666616257
Sentence: he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .

Sentence: on saturday he came again .
Perplexity : 3.0223031066617327

Perplexity : 3.028105726395324
Sentence: it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn .
Perplexity : 3.0399145137596073
Sentence: but our visitor was very obstinate .
Perplexity : 2.050334014643669
Sentence: i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .
Perplexity : 2.426858631262248
Sentence: he has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one .
Perplexity : 2.538061719792136
Sentence: nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .
Perplexity : 2.7795387317491214
Sentence: they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .
Perplexity : 2.7655918742910086
Sentence: but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .
Perplexity : 2.610360422797682
Sentence: but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .
Perplexity : 3.0024867096479437
Sentence: the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .
Perplexity : 3.422528611534944
Sentence: it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .
Perplexity : 2.9481864121406653
Sentence: perhaps there was some truth in this ; though i doubt whether his reserve , or anybody 's reserve , can be answerable for the event .
Perplexity : 2.791224626339749
Sentence: but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .
Perplexity : 2.7746671150019147
Sentence: when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .
Perplexity : 3.1205430083343715
Sentence: i believe i have now told you every thing .
Perplexity : 3.585839542184074
Sentence: it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .
Perplexity : 2.983622280057105
Sentence: lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house .
Perplexity : 2.9618255010221626

Sentence: mr. darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding .
Perplexity : 3.081916753512263
Sentence: he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday .
Perplexity : 2.8132812876488886
Sentence: will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him .
Perplexity : 2.867611067307453
Sentence: his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire .
Perplexity : 2.88837270475735
Sentence: his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .
Perplexity : 2.696625555583784
Sentence: i thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name .
Perplexity : 2.7075512226388705
Sentence: but slyness seems the fashion .
Perplexity : 1.66897243167916
Sentence: pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park .

Perplexity : 2.41244760824066
Sentence: gardiner . ''
Perplexity : 1.7852870439896997
Sentence: the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sister 's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !
Perplexity : 2.586043556976832
Sentence: he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .
Perplexity : 2.52199277344807
Sentence: he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .
Perplexity : 2.896845250065809
Sentence: her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .
Perplexity : 3.3217372236382467
Sentence: but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .
Perplexity : 2.7379661672730773
Sentence: brother in law of wickham !
Perplexity : 2.913769425696546
Sentence: every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .

Sentence: he had to be sure done much .
Perplexity : 3.5420206780369976

Perplexity : 2.717032801704
Sentence: to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley .

Perplexity : 2.4838574649430085

Perplexity : 3.0180714407619935

Perplexity : 3.0766823192209363
Sentence: elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .
Perplexity : 2.7786439764234836
Sentence: the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .
Perplexity : 2.5626568440806925
Sentence: lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 2.6159157328078098
Sentence: it was a rational scheme to be sure !
Perplexity : 2.870159922935568
Sentence: but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .
Perplexity : 3.142130598484974

Perplexity : 2.9335945069642864
Sentence: she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
Perplexity : 2.880309121998449
Sentence: with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .
Perplexity : 2.3778241635549744
Sentence: if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .
Perplexity : 2.7876583790006633
Sentence: in that case he would return no more .
Perplexity : 2.924193073112165

Perplexity : 2.638766183274806
Sentence: the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs. bennet 's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .
Perplexity : 2.7607457137672413
Sentence: the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .
Perplexity : 3.1294749660524976
Sentence: `` lizzy , '' said he , `` i was going to look for you ; come into my room . ''
Perplexity : 2.8926868059646305
Sentence: she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .
Perplexity : 3.1900996278367497
Sentence: it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .

Perplexity : 3.0217854287625436
Sentence: the colour now rushed into elizabeth 's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , '' you look conscious .
Perplexity : 2.723764171299277
Sentence: young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .

Sentence: this letter is from mr .

Perplexity : 2.6756914289635647
Sentence: `` have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ?
Perplexity : 2.9634987700470887
Sentence: but now it comes out . ''
Perplexity : 2.20730869156277

Perplexity : 2.7647586576579286
Sentence: i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . ''
Perplexity : 2.9541749500051298
Sentence: `` mr. collins moreover adds , '' `` i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .

Sentence: i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .
Perplexity : 2.435475061646989

Perplexity : 2.8157998997997344
Sentence: nay , when i read a letter of his , i can not help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law .
Perplexity : 2.831993075359506
Sentence: and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ?
Perplexity : 2.9977823201228033

Perplexity : 3.2758463831243647
Sentence: it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .
Perplexity : 3.0004514509557834
Sentence: her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr. darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .

Sentence: instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine 's visit .

Sentence: they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other .
Perplexity : 3.1019980153099636

Sentence: my affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . ''
Perplexity : 2.518452779606229
Sentence: elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .
Perplexity : 2.692133805102587
Sentence: the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .
Perplexity : 2.871388646289133
Sentence: had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .
Perplexity : 2.782567331061007
Sentence: they walked on , without knowing in what direction .
Perplexity : 2.8441903542141644
Sentence: there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .
Perplexity : 3.725456671803316
Sentence: but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .
Perplexity : 2.3694037762843627
Sentence: `` it taught me to hope , '' said he , `` as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .
Perplexity : 3.028656605522524
Sentence: i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly . ''
Perplexity : 2.880733644847369
Sentence: elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , `` yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .
Perplexity : 2.822771028134095
Sentence: after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . ''

Sentence: i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . ''
Perplexity : 3.088468161061675

Sentence: i hope you have destroyed the letter .
Perplexity : 2.8284695052386093
Sentence: there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again .

Perplexity : 2.451980685179337

Perplexity : 2.9211244423935754

Perplexity : 2.647811013157211
Sentence: but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .
Perplexity : 2.7263886351852924
Sentence: in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .

Sentence: how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
Perplexity : 2.6297262099990095
Sentence: it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 2.9704498236710397
Sentence: `` or in other words , you are determined to have him .
Perplexity : 2.9421814599311156

Perplexity : 3.2301992680032634
Sentence: i now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .
Perplexity : 3.0229730848010634
Sentence: but let me advise you to think better of it .
Perplexity : 2.6181303237348668

Perplexity : 2.0766483888979934
Sentence: elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
Perplexity : 2.551915461924749
Sentence: `` well , my dear , '' said he , when she ceased speaking , `` i have no more to say .
Perplexity : 2.872446675972877
Sentence: i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy . ''
Perplexity : 3.112752809242802
