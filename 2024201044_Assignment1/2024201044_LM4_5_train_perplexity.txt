Perplexity : 3.1973554598372727
Sentence: elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .
Perplexity : 2.6990219370764557

Sentence: they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .
Perplexity : 2.6283608933369216

Sentence: his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs. hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .

Perplexity : 2.836196930144833

Sentence: if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs. long .
Perplexity : 3.4647132702600127

Perplexity : 2.493389962324681

Perplexity : 2.754722996740321
Sentence: miss bennet 's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest .
Perplexity : 3.021573713460468
Sentence: by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother 's admiration .
Perplexity : 2.897422832965531
Sentence: it was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .
Perplexity : 2.8755855206393806
Sentence: she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas .
Perplexity : 2.770768799887564
Sentence: `` it may perhaps be pleasant , '' replied charlotte , `` to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .
Perplexity : 2.831265408627429
Sentence: if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .
Perplexity : 2.575722246280751
Sentence: there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .
Perplexity : 2.8647804357445423
Sentence: we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .
Perplexity : 2.7374356932970683
Sentence: in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .
Perplexity : 2.377206697524031
Sentence: bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . ''
Perplexity : 3.0375053840778072
Sentence: `` but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .
Perplexity : 3.2712353807582444
Sentence: if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . ''
Perplexity : 2.5968469554497164
Sentence: `` but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . ''
Perplexity : 3.219129738729291
Sentence: `` perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .
Perplexity : 3.6040824640073015
Sentence: but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .
Perplexity : 2.7151281389648583
Sentence: jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .
Perplexity : 2.9021590515747913
Sentence: when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . ''
Perplexity : 2.9316402921524647
Sentence: `` your plan is a good one , '' replied elizabeth , `` where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it .
Perplexity : 2.874416336997635
Sentence: but these are not jane 's feelings ; she is not acting by design .
Perplexity : 3.3065027130595315
Sentence: as yet , she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .
Perplexity : 3.0749490730656373
Sentence: she has known him only a fortnight .
Perplexity : 2.8567566902313954
Sentence: she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .
Perplexity : 2.9978120895065077
Sentence: this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . ''
Perplexity : 3.0441285745836018
Sentence: `` not as you represent it .
Perplexity : 2.377078019464073
Sentence: had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . ''
Perplexity : 2.568607229383811
Sentence: `` yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded . ''
Perplexity : 2.2118228475319506
Sentence: `` you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .
Perplexity : 3.1251728550321056
Sentence: you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . ''
Perplexity : 3.424492290723446
Sentence: occupied in observing mr. bingley 's attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .
Perplexity : 2.842919965558595
Sentence: but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .
Perplexity : 2.586762179382362
Sentence: to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .
Perplexity : 2.0340997882065714
Sentence: of this she was perfectly unaware ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .
Perplexity : 3.1975275437582646
Sentence: he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .
Perplexity : 3.4162971378075295
Sentence: his doing so drew her notice .
Perplexity : 1.815402264975713
Sentence: `` what does mr. darcy mean , '' said she to charlotte , `` by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? ''
Perplexity : 3.271190976247196
Sentence: `` but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about .
Perplexity : 3.447894009654689
Sentence: he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him . ''
Perplexity : 2.5504745838637306
Sentence: on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , '' did not you think , mr. darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? ''
Perplexity : 3.0551655792175336
Sentence: `` you are severe on us . ''
Perplexity : 2.453672750517845
Sentence: `` it will be her turn soon to be teazed , '' said miss lucas .
Perplexity : 2.896289824160706
Sentence: `` i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows . ''
Perplexity : 2.9263101302987202
Sentence: `` you are a very strange creature by way of a friend !
Perplexity : 3.00448733773777
Sentence: on miss lucas 's persevering , however , she added , `` very well ; if it must be so , it must . ''
Perplexity : 3.2178212779316446
Sentence: and gravely glancing at mr. darcy , `` there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and i shall keep mine to swell my song . ''
Perplexity : 2.2297496874439253
Sentence: after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .
Perplexity : 2.6312801927534033
Sentence: mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .
Perplexity : 2.423677947457734
Sentence: mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began .
Perplexity : 2.6713228483191562
Sentence: `` what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr. darcy !

Sentence: `` your friend performs delightfully ; '' he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group ; `` and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr .
Perplexity : 2.546399736577225
Sentence: `` you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir . ''
Perplexity : 2.918954142402833
Sentence: james 's ? ''

Sentence: `` never , sir . ''
Perplexity : 2.1493568974085586
Sentence: `` do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? ''

Perplexity : 2.2832834955140044
Sentence: `` i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas . ''

Perplexity : 2.7758982615629297

Sentence: `` certainly not . ''
Perplexity : 2.614487831450509

Perplexity : 3.072329390451491

Sentence: `` if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside , '' cried bingley , `` it would not make them one jot less agreeable . ''
Perplexity : 2.6309266752159512

Perplexity : 2.6756327598287832

Perplexity : 2.482536433657464
Sentence: she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .

Perplexity : 2.6479655875153623

Perplexity : 2.8825580202312584
Sentence: the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .

Perplexity : 2.836437468803621
Sentence: the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday .
Perplexity : 2.8112965255720486

Sentence: they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennet 's civilities .

Sentence: the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .
Perplexity : 2.6981550273276453
Sentence: mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .
Perplexity : 2.725762216202873
Sentence: jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr. wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr. darcy 's looks and behaviour .
Perplexity : 2.975989450502974
Sentence: the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .
Perplexity : 2.7814275881728148
Sentence: `` while i can have my mornings to myself , '' said she , `` it is enough .
Perplexity : 2.954850066683498
Sentence: i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .
Perplexity : 2.422602001909272
Sentence: society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body . ''
Perplexity : 2.203811562062261
Sentence: elizabeth 's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley 's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening 's amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance .
Perplexity : 2.687081094027806
Sentence: she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances : and to have mr. collins instead !
Perplexity : 2.5542266045201725
Sentence: her liveliness had been never worse timed .
Perplexity : 2.3041687742703636
Sentence: there was no help for it however .
Perplexity : 3.3782179677303783
Sentence: mr. wickham 's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr. collins 's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .
Perplexity : 2.815293613256345
Sentence: she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .
Perplexity : 3.2407941741902153
Sentence: it now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .
Perplexity : 2.449080358261459
Sentence: elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .
Perplexity : 2.7439751540674533
Sentence: if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once .
Perplexity : 2.9624470666969196
Sentence: no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy .
Perplexity : 2.226387585194854
Sentence: even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia .
Perplexity : 2.5029341760018315
Sentence: till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .
Perplexity : 2.5783554194625005
Sentence: the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .
Perplexity : 2.2751430252695948
Sentence: she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .
Perplexity : 2.4939292018172785
Sentence: but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcy 's pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr. denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , '' i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . ''
Perplexity : 2.7527751220685244
Sentence: this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .
Perplexity : 2.669366074635667
Sentence: attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .
Perplexity : 2.347535184338051
Sentence: she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .
Perplexity : 2.6952160147490227
Sentence: but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .
Perplexity : 2.8477755768301556
Sentence: mr. collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .
Perplexity : 2.378101788599095
Sentence: she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .
Perplexity : 2.9204376471183995
Sentence: when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .
Perplexity : 3.061979047114282
Sentence: he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her .
Perplexity : 2.6073229554817865
Sentence: `` i dare say you will find him very agreeable . ''
Perplexity : 2.7102099827622355
Sentence: `` heaven forbid !
Perplexity : 1.5298396314250564
Sentence: that would be the greatest misfortune of all !
Perplexity : 3.380319845856026
Sentence: to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !
Perplexity : 2.7828639019529624
Sentence: do not wish me such an evil . ''
Perplexity : 2.6717770645350565
Sentence: when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .
Perplexity : 2.510571297229987
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .
Perplexity : 2.439817308077383
Sentence: they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .
Perplexity : 2.770807788816652
Sentence: he replied , and was again silent .
Perplexity : 3.584477354487687
Sentence: after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with '' it is your turn to say something now , mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 2.801864679658945
Sentence: i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . ''
Perplexity : 2.456093872999628
Sentence: he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .
Perplexity : 3.1385646724204825
Sentence: that reply will do for the present .
Perplexity : 2.694640344530975
Sentence: perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .
Perplexity : 1.846318445914302
Sentence: but now we may be silent . ''
Perplexity : 3.3988161513003785
Sentence: `` do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? ''
Perplexity : 2.6331084957148945
Sentence: `` sometimes .
Perplexity : 1.7403690267035519
Sentence: one must speak a little , you know .
Perplexity : 3.3239453511453108
Sentence: it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . ''
Perplexity : 2.592967256813941
Sentence: `` both , '' replied elizabeth archly ; `` for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .
Perplexity : 2.555022142623479
Sentence: we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . ''
Perplexity : 2.3394567197621305
Sentence: `` this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , '' said he .
Perplexity : 2.9785835281394615
Sentence: you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly . ''
Perplexity : 2.441999665182867
Sentence: `` i must not decide on my own performance . ''
Perplexity : 2.85242258872379
Sentence: he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton .
Perplexity : 3.2697993488044217
Sentence: the effect was immediate .
Perplexity : 2.487500022345769
Sentence: at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , '' mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . ''
Perplexity : 2.7220902657115684
Sentence: `` he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , '' replied elizabeth with emphasis , `` and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . ''
Perplexity : 3.0239467345550484
Sentence: at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr. darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .
Perplexity : 2.5536163141432047
Sentence: `` i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir .
Perplexity : 3.083780076078079
Sentence: such very superior dancing is not often seen .

Sentence: allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley , ) shall take place .
Perplexity : 2.769992182030495
Sentence: what congratulations will then flow in !
Perplexity : 1.8590342917432823
Sentence: i appeal to mr. darcy : but let me not interrupt you , sir .
Perplexity : 2.529022748440856
Sentence: you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . ''
Perplexity : 2.148441154500053
Sentence: the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william 's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together .
Perplexity : 2.7752782238937463
Sentence: recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , '' sir william 's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . ''
Perplexity : 2.709697373479226
Sentence: `` i do not think we were speaking at all .
Perplexity : 3.0835057626533833
Sentence: sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .
Perplexity : 3.0493886521940996

Sentence: `` what think you of books ? ''
Perplexity : 2.8078185867523433
Sentence: said he , smiling .
Perplexity : 2.172930918434455
Sentence: `` books oh !
Perplexity : 1.7117007410346843
Sentence: <s> no .
Perplexity : 1.739758263734505
Sentence: i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . ''
Perplexity : 2.973653967034519
Sentence: `` i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject .
Perplexity : 3.224874440504326
Sentence: we may compare our different opinions . ''
Perplexity : 1.6453905662938106
Sentence: `` no i can not talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of something else . ''
Perplexity : 2.7501521575205516
Sentence: `` the present always occupies you in such scenes does it ? ''
Perplexity : 2.3813511310295454
Sentence: said he , with a look of doubt .
Perplexity : 2.799793038009438
Sentence: `` yes , always , '' she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , `` i remember hearing you once say , mr. darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .
Perplexity : 2.777697742255607
Sentence: you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its being created . ''
Perplexity : 2.853255789792845
Sentence: `` i am , '' said he , with a firm voice .

Sentence: `` i do not get on at all .
Perplexity : 2.715253334378404
Sentence: i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . ''
Perplexity : 2.2271487571467796
Sentence: `` i can readily believe , '' answered he gravely , `` that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . ''
Perplexity : 2.7690669401110997
Sentence: `` but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity . ''
Perplexity : 3.024189067744913
Sentence: `` i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , '' he coldly replied .
Perplexity : 2.5440028557432015
Sentence: she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy 's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .
Perplexity : 2.6810941805121544

Sentence: your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr. darcy 's steward .
Perplexity : 2.9015036899207214
Sentence: let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr. darcy 's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner .
Perplexity : 2.8394106872326628
Sentence: i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame , that he can not bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .
Perplexity : 3.0617420354575504
Sentence: his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .
Perplexity : 2.905995534539979
Sentence: i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ''
Perplexity : 2.663530630105634
Sentence: `` his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , '' said elizabeth angrily ; `` for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcy 's steward , and of that , i can assure you , he informed me himself . ''
Perplexity : 2.7727495142174328
Sentence: `` i beg your pardon , '' replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .
Perplexity : 2.5554524853578067

Perplexity : 2.5104644027814773
Sentence: jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .
Perplexity : 2.4304824651654147
Sentence: elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane 's being in the fairest way for happiness .
Perplexity : 2.6693386967535186
Sentence: but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ''
Perplexity : 2.9044275783838547
Sentence: `` no , '' replied jane , `` i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you .
Perplexity : 2.9189715900342432
Sentence: mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister 's , mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
Perplexity : 3.137548226639907
Sentence: i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr. darcy 's regard . ''
Perplexity : 2.9228639234291003
Sentence: `` mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself ? ''
Perplexity : 3.2782309970904606
Sentence: `` this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 3.0528099063910568
Sentence: but what does he say of the living ? ''
Perplexity : 2.707014489573665
Sentence: `` he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only . ''
Perplexity : 2.851499261633361
Sentence: `` i have not a doubt of mr. bingley 's sincerity , '' said elizabeth warmly ; '' but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
Perplexity : 2.671587780127131
Sentence: mr. bingley 's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before . ''
Perplexity : 2.641933158593586
Sentence: she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .
Perplexity : 2.7741950258424843
Sentence: elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley 's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .
Perplexity : 2.5587606305397865
Sentence: on their being joined by mr. bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr. collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
Perplexity : 2.8588781467656164

Sentence: how wonderfully these sort of things occur !
Perplexity : 2.057948781620053

Perplexity : 2.6601792663273263
Sentence: i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .
Perplexity : 2.782118797871643
Sentence: my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . ''
Perplexity : 1.8618434818369423
Sentence: `` you are not going to introduce yourself to mr .
Perplexity : 2.6634365548399206
Sentence: darcy ? ''
Perplexity : 1.755596771151838
Sentence: `` indeed i am .
Perplexity : 4.409132579894907
Sentence: elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr. darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .
Perplexity : 2.7451465651836418
Sentence: mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , '' my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .
Perplexity : 2.472467147844382
Sentence: you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty .
Perplexity : 2.4809275082422166
Sentence: pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . ''
Perplexity : 2.424482869864326
Sentence: and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .
Perplexity : 2.4032402463344997
Sentence: her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words `` apology , '' '' hunsford , '' and `` lady catherine de bourgh . ''
Perplexity : 2.718433915196374
Sentence: it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .
Perplexity : 2.934528596615182
Sentence: mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr. collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .
Perplexity : 2.6900171826237327
Sentence: mr. collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr. darcy 's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .
Perplexity : 2.5658880840597202
Sentence: mr. collins then returned to elizabeth .
Perplexity : 4.46917630536621
Sentence: `` i have no reason , i assure you , '' said he , `` to be dissatisfied with my reception .
Perplexity : 2.7187199802471707
Sentence: mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .
Perplexity : 3.295102153388728
Sentence: he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine 's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .

Sentence: it was really a very handsome thought .
Perplexity : 3.086981597996752
Sentence: upon the whole , i am much pleased with him . ''
Perplexity : 3.1194577547468123
Sentence: as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .
Perplexity : 2.685894147355506
Sentence: she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley 's two sisters .
Perplexity : 2.9253718195361382
Sentence: her mother 's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .
Perplexity : 2.5330196004126333
Sentence: when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr. bingley .
Perplexity : 2.7646774924930027
Sentence: it was an animating subject , and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .
Perplexity : 2.460890425670619
Sentence: his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .
Perplexity : 3.0588987373692906
Sentence: it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane 's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .
Perplexity : 2.8749580618047714
Sentence: it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .
Perplexity : 2.81254957953721
Sentence: she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .
Perplexity : 2.4972642502979814
Sentence: in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother 's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy , who sat opposite to them .
Perplexity : 2.456194003628661
Sentence: her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .
Perplexity : 2.6590763534352613
Sentence: `` for heaven 's sake , madam , speak lower .
Perplexity : 2.130578648977166
Sentence: what advantage can it be to you to offend mr. darcy ?
Perplexity : 3.0546841275030046
Sentence: you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . ''
Perplexity : 2.7775414698410956
Sentence: nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .
Perplexity : 3.3485875920555626
Sentence: elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .
Perplexity : 1.8476712138081814
Sentence: she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr. darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .
Perplexity : 2.9004629181847483
Sentence: the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .
Perplexity : 2.0091020316478745
Sentence: at length however mrs. bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .
Perplexity : 2.5798492504481034
Sentence: but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .
Perplexity : 2.599350525631414
Sentence: by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .
Perplexity : 2.4983742680010557
Sentence: elizabeth 's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .
Perplexity : 2.659017495464287
Sentence: elizabeth was in agonies .
Perplexity : 2.953642213937807
Sentence: she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .

Sentence: she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night .
Perplexity : 2.182472663257894
Sentence: he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , '' that will do extremely well , child .
Perplexity : 2.7837503278576
Sentence: you have delighted us long enough .
Perplexity : 2.574224646811341
Sentence: let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . ''
Perplexity : 2.6178422119517735
Sentence: mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father 's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .
Perplexity : 2.8421534376814974
Sentence: others of the party were now applied to .
Perplexity : 3.157877640945997
Sentence: i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .
Perplexity : 2.7757711140750034
Sentence: the rector of a parish has much to do .
Perplexity : 2.5249225539340916
Sentence: in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .
Perplexity : 2.3752579625835035
Sentence: he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible .
Perplexity : 2.6576716769668036
Sentence: and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .
Perplexity : 2.4594710740336847
Sentence: i can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . ''
Perplexity : 2.508423769420535
Sentence: and with a bow to mr. darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .
Perplexity : 2.7084479551571032
Sentence: many stared .
Perplexity : 1.7405727573482888
Sentence: many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .
Perplexity : 2.812594603018116
Sentence: to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .
Perplexity : 3.0455975232028334
Sentence: that his two sisters and mr. darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .
Perplexity : 2.766536849511624
Sentence: she was teazed by mr. collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .
Perplexity : 2.756874585381552
Sentence: he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .
Perplexity : 3.0902030390796336
Sentence: there was no arguing upon such a project .
Perplexity : 2.006923489292299
Sentence: she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good naturedly engaged mr. collins 's conversation to herself .
Perplexity : 2.584553754057979
Sentence: she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy 's farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .
Perplexity : 2.8043334043487333
Sentence: she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham , and rejoiced in it .
Perplexity : 2.672258905329771
Sentence: the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .
Perplexity : 2.7850085327395213
Sentence: mrs. hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .
Perplexity : 2.6057122213457315
Sentence: they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins , who was complimenting mr. bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .
Perplexity : 2.6046920735011456

Sentence: mr. bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .
Perplexity : 2.8528375797091616
Sentence: mr. bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .
Perplexity : 2.8406609911642233
Sentence: elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of `` lord , how tired i am ! ''
Perplexity : 2.3732600098981527
Sentence: accompanied by a violent yawn .
Perplexity : 1.9208871125871387
Sentence: when at length they arose to take leave , mrs. bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .
Perplexity : 2.7954659544106595
Sentence: bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .
Perplexity : 2.8215301095078016
Sentence: mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months .
Perplexity : 2.5384985401134497
Sentence: of having another daughter married to mr. collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .
Perplexity : 2.8321937990895023

Sentence: mr. collins made his declaration in form .
Perplexity : 2.540551273063269

Perplexity : 2.7693102634893525

Perplexity : 2.582863490312132
Sentence: the idea of mr. collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : '' my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .
Perplexity : 2.570093419440609
Sentence: twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! )

Perplexity : 2.4505371190945064
Sentence: as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .
Perplexity : 2.7800318512936806
Sentence: he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .

Perplexity : 3.239847154028104
Sentence: she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .
Perplexity : 2.939877560845914

Sentence: `` i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .

Perplexity : 2.940462664185883
Sentence: to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley 's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .

Perplexity : 3.032436118897282
Sentence: i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .

Sentence: the possibility of mr. collins 's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , '' engaged to mr. collins !
Perplexity : 2.7978514755512434

Sentence: with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , '' good lord !

Sentence: do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 3.2725119760933397
Sentence: nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william 's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .
Perplexity : 2.4392162220003377

Sentence: in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .
Perplexity : 2.628982474373443

Sentence: my dear aunt , how could you think of it ?
Perplexity : 3.9133241643596586

Perplexity : 2.735119720220982
Sentence: it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane 's attractions .

Sentence: miss bennet accepted her aunt 's invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline 's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .

Sentence: without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .
Perplexity : 3.0391218218623264

Perplexity : 2.5209822135930633
Sentence: mrs. gardiner 's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : '' you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly .

Sentence: elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement .
Perplexity : 2.86978882008607

Perplexity : 2.550410944027839
Sentence: she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collins 's joints of meat were too large for her family .
Perplexity : 2.34765972847935
Sentence: elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr. collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .

Perplexity : 2.8783976371796554
Sentence: elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr. darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley 's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself .

Perplexity : 2.7672019565487807
Sentence: it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen 's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .

Perplexity : 2.5937518635021455
Sentence: elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin 's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .

Sentence: as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr. darcy , and mr. darcy only , entered the room .
Perplexity : 2.887767966115194
Sentence: he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .
Perplexity : 2.417767003194507
Sentence: they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .
Perplexity : 2.445051355613457
Sentence: it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , '' how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 2.752781799614049

Sentence: he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . ''
Perplexity : 2.8410398038332536
Sentence: `` if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .
Perplexity : 3.0642700646695795
Sentence: but perhaps mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . ''
Perplexity : 3.088627206785299
Sentence: `` i should not be surprised , '' said darcy , `` if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . ''

Sentence: elizabeth made no answer .
Perplexity : 1.9182654104399148

Perplexity : 3.1066475011383194
Sentence: he took the hint , and soon began with , `` this seems a very comfortable house .
Perplexity : 2.8130229830603626
Sentence: lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr. collins first came to hunsford . ''

Perplexity : 2.303270743445564
Sentence: `` yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .
Perplexity : 3.127675733572485
Sentence: my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did .
Perplexity : 2.6161949103303406
Sentence: `` an easy distance do you call it ?
Perplexity : 2.3639086591323677
Sentence: `` and what is fifty miles of good road ?
Perplexity : 2.847421996854747
Sentence: little more than half a day 's journey .

Sentence: any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far . ''
Perplexity : 2.892430897640192
Sentence: as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , '' i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .
Perplexity : 2.989519566409349
Sentence: the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .
Perplexity : 2.2840031273056707
Sentence: where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .
Perplexity : 2.224852790656949
Sentence: but that is not the case here .
Perplexity : 3.653283983489977
Sentence: mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , `` you can not have a right to such very strong local attachment .
Perplexity : 3.1460879120521046
Sentence: you can not have been always at longbourn . ''

Sentence: a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .
Perplexity : 2.3651769827903046
Sentence: mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .

Sentence: `` what can be the meaning of this ! ''
Perplexity : 3.912165297165447

Perplexity : 3.1716222425747636
Sentence: `` my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . ''
Perplexity : 2.935920101856884
Sentence: but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte 's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .
Perplexity : 3.146334687671368
Sentence: all field sports were over .
Perplexity : 1.8213731552971826
Sentence: within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen can not be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .
Perplexity : 2.8251594981027237
Sentence: it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam 's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .
Perplexity : 2.950905593960518
Sentence: but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .
Perplexity : 3.003507533658608
Sentence: he seldom appeared really animated .
Perplexity : 1.6690500982301384
Sentence: mrs. collins knew not what to make of him .
Perplexity : 3.2878721614537287
Sentence: colonel fitzwilliam 's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .
Perplexity : 3.051352795751002
Sentence: he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .
Perplexity : 2.9463853222203715

Perplexity : 2.657430954748839
Sentence: she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend 's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .
Perplexity : 2.96939798361639
Sentence: more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr. darcy .

Perplexity : 2.4180096892713583
Sentence: how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !
Perplexity : 2.2559862246995483
Sentence: yet it did , and even a third .
Perplexity : 3.0114768920574644
Sentence: it seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .
Perplexity : 2.5441891856873493
Sentence: he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collins 's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too .
Perplexity : 2.8332154740499313
Sentence: could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?
Perplexity : 3.1103940576945814

Sentence: are you going much farther ? ''
Perplexity : 2.2108842049501103
Sentence: `` no , i should have turned in a moment . ''
Perplexity : 2.8829262613885787
Sentence: and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .
Perplexity : 2.6966744017271704
Sentence: `` do you certainly leave kent on saturday ? ''

Sentence: `` yes if darcy does not put it off again .

Perplexity : 1.6631150531415637
Sentence: `` in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .
Perplexity : 2.9068285740172777
Sentence: now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ?
Perplexity : 2.5418485652533374
Sentence: when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? ''
Perplexity : 2.6360355229043337
Sentence: `` these are home questions and perhaps i can not say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature .
Perplexity : 2.533764761682729
Sentence: but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money .
Perplexity : 2.5344009948244186
Sentence: younger sons can not marry where they like . ''
Perplexity : 2.3870713564506842
Sentence: `` unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do . ''
Perplexity : 2.6120905065592677
Sentence: `` our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . ''
Perplexity : 2.435695185658957
Sentence: `` is this , '' thought elizabeth , `` meant for me ? ''
Perplexity : 3.2051235750432676
Sentence: and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , `` and pray , what is the usual price of an earl 's younger son ?
Perplexity : 2.8504637368193895
Sentence: unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . ''

Sentence: to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , '' i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .
Perplexity : 2.4450895245081528
Sentence: i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .
Perplexity : 2.5287202268780344
Sentence: but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . ''
Perplexity : 3.265590448528264
Sentence: `` no , '' said colonel fitzwilliam , `` that is an advantage which he must divide with me .
Perplexity : 2.835851293365856
Sentence: i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy . ''
Perplexity : 2.768970799839382
Sentence: `` are you , indeed ?
Perplexity : 4.240178332109068
Sentence: and pray what sort of guardians do you make ?
Perplexity : 2.4669120082435927
Sentence: does your charge give you much trouble ?
Perplexity : 2.287765550735552
Sentence: young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . ''
Perplexity : 3.042481692998729
Sentence: she directly replied , '' you need not be frightened .
Perplexity : 2.7538353809735527
Sentence: i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .
Perplexity : 2.6874656584357868
Sentence: she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs. hurst and miss bingley .
Perplexity : 3.1466012179788114
Sentence: i think i have heard you say that you know them . ''
Perplexity : 3.4187986961991617

Perplexity : 3.072364169891296
Sentence: yes , '' said elizabeth drily `` mr. darcy is uncommonly kind to mr. bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . ''
Perplexity : 2.4392543168616085
Sentence: `` care of him !
Perplexity : 3.677090293987335
Sentence: yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .
Perplexity : 2.6015131045227604
Sentence: but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant .
Perplexity : 3.0811579644434555
Sentence: it was all conjecture . ''
Perplexity : 3.0508722934363304
Sentence: `` it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady 's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . ''
Perplexity : 2.9511832225477037
Sentence: `` you may depend upon my not mentioning it . ''
Perplexity : 2.645017756327521
Sentence: what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . ''
Perplexity : 2.7580940599360373
Sentence: `` did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? ''
Perplexity : 2.8030322958286273
Sentence: `` i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . ''
Perplexity : 2.6956284367971945
Sentence: `` and what arts did he use to separate them ? ''
Perplexity : 2.378248316235297
Sentence: `` he did not talk to me of his own arts , '' said fitzwilliam smiling .
Perplexity : 2.9299032291188705
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .
Perplexity : 2.5009653529792852
Sentence: after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .
Perplexity : 2.596697887687904
Sentence: `` i am thinking of what you have been telling me , '' said she .
Perplexity : 3.0050075581664903
Sentence: why was he to be the judge ? ''
Perplexity : 2.5852818480763653
Sentence: `` you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? ''
Perplexity : 2.3977588713860167
Sentence: `` but , '' she continued , recollecting herself , `` as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .
Perplexity : 3.0678388150930966
Sentence: it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . ''
Perplexity : 3.0953692008199334
Sentence: `` that is not an unnatural surmise , '' said fitzwilliam , `` but it is lessening the honour of my cousin 's triumph very sadly . ''
Perplexity : 2.443299859771858
Sentence: this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr. darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .
Perplexity : 2.6504377935128836
Sentence: there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .
Perplexity : 2.9924945345741496
Sentence: it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .
Perplexity : 2.9702551409949747
Sentence: there could not exist in the world two men , over whom mr. darcy could have such boundless influence .
Perplexity : 2.602945517526667
Sentence: that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr. bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .
Perplexity : 2.6794956204987317
Sentence: if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .
Perplexity : 2.847871955583364
Sentence: `` there were some very strong objections against the lady , '' were colonel fitzwilliam 's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london .
Perplexity : 2.9420737061956324
Sentence: `` to jane herself , '' she exclaimed , `` there could be no possibility of objection .
Perplexity : 3.401752806760644
Sentence: her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .
Perplexity : 2.5437311129130427
Sentence: neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . ''
Perplexity : 2.5727491732798042
Sentence: when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr. darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend 's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister .
Perplexity : 2.82977865838857
Sentence: the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .
Perplexity : 2.579399459455562
Sentence: mrs. collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr. collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine 's being rather displeased by her staying at home .
Perplexity : 2.836580593101114
Sentence: when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent .
Perplexity : 2.788082868409426
Sentence: they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .
Perplexity : 2.0237656419472803
Sentence: but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .
Perplexity : 2.7646429103385604
Sentence: elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .
Perplexity : 2.473172202305044
Sentence: mr. darcy 's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister 's sufferings .
Perplexity : 2.2977848008038717
Sentence: while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .
Perplexity : 2.552616118627694
Sentence: but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr. darcy walk into the room .
Perplexity : 2.8648868434992845
Sentence: in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .
Perplexity : 2.570175329927391
Sentence: she answered him with cold civility .
Perplexity : 2.5743814031125014
Sentence: elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .
Perplexity : 3.3029253804594396
Sentence: after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , '' in vain have i struggled .
Perplexity : 2.892375115777003
Sentence: it will not do .
Perplexity : 5.01937818075399
Sentence: my feelings will not be repressed .
Perplexity : 2.4864557725804954
Sentence: you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you . ''
Perplexity : 2.2647186608562486
Sentence: elizabeth 's astonishment was beyond expression .
Perplexity : 2.5955233637530344
Sentence: she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .
Perplexity : 2.223701000119216
Sentence: he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .
Perplexity : 2.8189129679242955
Sentence: his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .
Perplexity : 2.390914913468889
Sentence: in spite of her deeply rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man 's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .
Perplexity : 2.5374381407060485
Sentence: she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .
Perplexity : 2.780473495523131
Sentence: he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .
Perplexity : 2.48335026413264
Sentence: such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , '' in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .
Perplexity : 2.6171754423087537
Sentence: it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you .
Perplexity : 3.1121359723709325
Sentence: i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .
Perplexity : 2.7508593267091626
Sentence: it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration .
Perplexity : 2.958334548678683
Sentence: the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . ''
Perplexity : 2.758801890877091
Sentence: mr. darcy , who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .
Perplexity : 2.417878588500382
Sentence: his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .
Perplexity : 2.165499993035431
Sentence: he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .
Perplexity : 2.448673546539476
Sentence: at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , '' and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !
Perplexity : 3.194244568053288
Sentence: i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected .
Perplexity : 2.8059176633540583
Sentence: but it is of small importance . ''
Perplexity : 3.0234988195354453
Sentence: `` i might as well enquire , '' replied she , `` why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?
Perplexity : 2.777867741225196
Sentence: was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil ?
Perplexity : 2.7236070450440315
Sentence: but i have other provocations .
Perplexity : 3.228206959676057
Sentence: you know i have .
Perplexity : 7.4037853476398645
Sentence: had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? ''
Perplexity : 2.8507190688099193
Sentence: as she pronounced these words , mr. darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .
Perplexity : 2.582025331660117
Sentence: `` i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .
Perplexity : 3.3941432763934785
Sentence: no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .
Perplexity : 1.7058165666202423
Sentence: you dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . ''
Perplexity : 2.475299688802956
Sentence: she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .
Perplexity : 2.3214931678234265
Sentence: he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .
Perplexity : 2.431925617466974
Sentence: `` can you deny that you have done it ? ''
Perplexity : 2.915234311326322
Sentence: she repeated .
Perplexity : 1.7405727573482888
Sentence: with assumed tranquillity he then replied , `` i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success .
Perplexity : 2.8818077099793
Sentence: towards him i have been kinder than towards myself . ''
Perplexity : 2.2293118682051545
Sentence: elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .
Perplexity : 2.218429891801079
Sentence: `` but it is not merely this affair , '' she continued , `` on which my dislike is founded .
Perplexity : 2.966046681183039
Sentence: long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .
Perplexity : 3.203431059048549
Sentence: your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 2.619702139844319
Sentence: on this subject , what can you have to say ?
Perplexity : 4.3434525851085315
Sentence: or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? ''
Perplexity : 2.0346963272576675
Sentence: `` you take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns , '' said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .
Perplexity : 2.8860036695761413
Sentence: `` his misfortunes ! ''
Perplexity : 2.0124519893701294
Sentence: `` you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .
Perplexity : 2.4148717057909503
Sentence: you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .
Perplexity : 2.8779173853850066
Sentence: you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .
Perplexity : 2.889237528688415
Sentence: you have done all this !
Perplexity : 4.124628566712119
Sentence: and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . ''
Perplexity : 2.1203274100617016
Sentence: `` and this , '' cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , '' is your opinion of me !
Perplexity : 3.3372914983973425
Sentence: this is the estimation in which you hold me !
Perplexity : 2.689166853755356
Sentence: these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing .
Perplexity : 2.247071482987962
Sentence: but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .
Perplexity : 2.212573915006124
Sentence: they were natural and just .
Perplexity : 3.031890214727073
Sentence: could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?
Perplexity : 2.4394427950603514
Sentence: to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? ''
Perplexity : 2.4536629821662546
Sentence: elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , '' you are mistaken , mr. darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ''
Perplexity : 2.8297277029032104
Sentence: she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , '' you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ''
Perplexity : 3.1041963006168256
Sentence: again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .
Perplexity : 2.320785280957013
Sentence: she went on .
Perplexity : 3.9377688102412356
Sentence: `` from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry . ''
Perplexity : 2.790058022048667
Sentence: `` you have said quite enough , madam .
Perplexity : 3.368645998033847
Sentence: i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .
Perplexity : 3.4833921383303155
Sentence: forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . ''
Perplexity : 2.9209247445568383
Sentence: and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .
Perplexity : 2.5655603548607027
Sentence: the tumult of her mind was now painfully great .
Perplexity : 2.379673939234334
Sentence: she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .
Perplexity : 2.454444703725958
Sentence: her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .
Perplexity : 2.6405467312351303
Sentence: that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 2.855705633336228
Sentence: so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend 's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !
Perplexity : 3.035579745223826
Sentence: it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .
Perplexity : 2.0886351877438374
Sentence: but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr. wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .
Perplexity : 2.624933406286749
Sentence: elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .
Perplexity : 2.4121210875939214
Sentence: she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr. darcy 's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .
Perplexity : 2.4473076673847016
Sentence: the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .
Perplexity : 2.3772313665808382
Sentence: the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .
Perplexity : 2.6894874567738682
Sentence: she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr. darcy , she was directly retreating .
Perplexity : 2.525016366619024
Sentence: but the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .
Perplexity : 2.3567805452122803
Sentence: she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy , she moved again towards the gate .
Perplexity : 3.0757616289035545
Sentence: he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , `` i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .
Perplexity : 2.6938089735638022
Sentence: will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? ''
Perplexity : 2.7298601088447825
Sentence: and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .
Perplexity : 2.7646057332420093
Sentence: with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand .
Perplexity : 2.5487789726631274
Sentence: the envelope itself was likewise full .
Perplexity : 1.794905780847533
Sentence: pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .
Perplexity : 2.5562394033001308
Sentence: it was dated from rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows : `` be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you .
Perplexity : 2.5525697848796813
Sentence: i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .
Perplexity : 2.651504823137862
Sentence: you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice .
Perplexity : 2.6197198217620477
Sentence: the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr. bingley from your sister , and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 2.592615669526582
Sentence: wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .
Perplexity : 2.619402506551909
Sentence: but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .
Perplexity : 2.4681975882483767
Sentence: the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd .
Perplexity : 2.149449190095463
Sentence: i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country .
Perplexity : 3.2028466379562848
Sentence: but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .
Perplexity : 3.4251650764326413
Sentence: i had often seen him in love before .
Perplexity : 3.453695699613617
Sentence: he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .
Perplexity : 3.376053950919969
Sentence: your sister i also watched .
Perplexity : 2.4884561788965964
Sentence: her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening 's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .
Perplexity : 2.572665679945064
Sentence: if you have not been mistaken here , i must have been in an error .
Perplexity : 3.7306185258236235
Sentence: your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .
Perplexity : 2.9939853415244846
Sentence: if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .
Perplexity : 2.7187977987130862
Sentence: but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister 's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .
Perplexity : 2.759025079551443
Sentence: that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .
Perplexity : 2.330097014446392
Sentence: i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ; i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason .
Perplexity : 2.8833705891805828
Sentence: my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .
Perplexity : 2.794829775841711
Sentence: but there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .
Perplexity : 2.4189868684387354
Sentence: these causes must be stated , though briefly .
Perplexity : 1.81398232544586
Sentence: the situation of your mother 's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .
Perplexity : 2.6735808447640097
Sentence: pardon me .
Perplexity : 2.9625052267753045
Sentence: it pains me to offend you .
Perplexity : 1.9301033779616832
Sentence: i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .
Perplexity : 2.910488822873689
Sentence: the part which i acted , is now to be explained .
Perplexity : 2.611995614100172
Sentence: we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .
Perplexity : 2.6733326927362024
Sentence: i described , and enforced them earnestly .
Perplexity : 1.6717186263544765
Sentence: but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .
Perplexity : 2.534060531197561
Sentence: to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .
Perplexity : 2.981304732980131
Sentence: to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .
Perplexity : 2.7291218629860703
Sentence: i can not blame myself for having done thus much .
Perplexity : 2.6245491434046984
Sentence: there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town .
Perplexity : 2.802637712105134
Sentence: i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .
Perplexity : 3.510980104401699
Sentence: that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .
Perplexity : 2.9242522267107054
Sentence: perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .
Perplexity : 2.0313080461656847
Sentence: it is done , however , and it was done for the best .
Perplexity : 3.366652700345194
Sentence: on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .
Perplexity : 3.102846488217818
Sentence: if i have wounded your sister 's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them .
Perplexity : 2.4161383108595853
Sentence: with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr. wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .
Perplexity : 2.587601248487176
Sentence: of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .
Perplexity : 2.6205257269613487
Sentence: mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .
Perplexity : 2.8246190353302025
Sentence: my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education .
Perplexity : 2.6095109724490997
Sentence: my father was not only fond of this young man 's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .
Perplexity : 2.9919521958053217
Sentence: as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner .
Perplexity : 3.3654264769543523
Sentence: the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr. darcy could not have .
Perplexity : 2.622678531293488
Sentence: but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .
Perplexity : 2.438147681745789
Sentence: it adds even another motive .
Perplexity : 1.7188669996685806
Sentence: my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .
Perplexity : 2.722534942337824
Sentence: there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .
Perplexity : 2.199952821758632
Sentence: his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr. wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .
Perplexity : 2.6581407995972177
Sentence: he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .
Perplexity : 2.9377400563413145
Sentence: i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .
Perplexity : 2.7041759661267104
Sentence: i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman .
Perplexity : 3.1636341665385284
Sentence: the business was therefore soon settled .
Perplexity : 3.029596659094912
Sentence: he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .
Perplexity : 2.7266277340894898
Sentence: all connection between us seemed now dissolved .
Perplexity : 1.88298713052074
Sentence: i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town .
Perplexity : 2.735019025160844
Sentence: in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .
Perplexity : 2.6457193340258662
Sentence: for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .
Perplexity : 2.6419929045519055
Sentence: his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .
Perplexity : 2.9919783206337525
Sentence: he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions .
Perplexity : 2.8890534587334007
Sentence: you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .
Perplexity : 2.373340261293124
Sentence: after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .
Perplexity : 2.46326388863792
Sentence: how he lived i know not .
Perplexity : 2.9405116445839288
Sentence: but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
Perplexity : 2.3609456164112155
Sentence: i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .
Perplexity : 2.751226302096089
Sentence: having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy .
Perplexity : 2.55721304729132
Sentence: my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .
Perplexity : 2.8869228026844045
Sentence: about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .
Perplexity : 2.7542581378764535
Sentence: she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .
Perplexity : 3.0071716585884283
Sentence: i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .
Perplexity : 2.485361039614684
Sentence: regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge .
Perplexity : 2.6589135288362433
Sentence: his revenge would have been complete indeed .
Perplexity : 2.066301733325501
Sentence: this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 2.6252824725863704
Sentence: i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .
Perplexity : 2.91877996609569
Sentence: you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .
Perplexity : 2.952310542800787
Sentence: but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .
Perplexity : 3.0365722254065157
Sentence: for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .
Perplexity : 2.4356704871648973
Sentence: if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .
Perplexity : 2.6377874170903186
Sentence: i will only add , god bless you .
Perplexity : 2.2978553273062015
Sentence: `` fitzwilliam darcy . ''
Perplexity : 2.113140135802416
Sentence: if elizabeth , when mr. darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .
Perplexity : 2.888098792247337
Sentence: but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .
Perplexity : 2.7642105924649947
Sentence: her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .
Perplexity : 2.5936605486516946
Sentence: with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .
Perplexity : 2.892224831700995
Sentence: with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield .
Perplexity : 3.010867193261782
Sentence: she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .
Perplexity : 2.65193155697199
Sentence: he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .
Perplexity : 2.3364334976669574
Sentence: it was all pride and insolence .
Perplexity : 2.856901515612743
Sentence: but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .
Perplexity : 2.6064221292973864
Sentence: astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .
Perplexity : 2.1940554562219234
Sentence: she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , `` this must be false !
Perplexity : 2.5967374257279667
Sentence: this must be the grossest falsehood ! ''
Perplexity : 2.21958945621527
Sentence: and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .
Perplexity : 2.9903666659957095
Sentence: in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .
Perplexity : 2.753930420951696
Sentence: the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .
Perplexity : 2.805098645415334
Sentence: so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .
Perplexity : 3.066563033685792
Sentence: what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .
Perplexity : 2.6703684619797277
Sentence: but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham 's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .
Perplexity : 2.3558378174750936
Sentence: she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success .
Perplexity : 2.170946041643479
Sentence: on both sides it was only assertion .
Perplexity : 2.387452431227267
Sentence: but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr. darcy 's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .
Perplexity : 2.632743486207162
Sentence: she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .

Perplexity : 2.6396655064458403
Sentence: and then when we came away it was such fun !

Sentence: but of this answer lydia heard not a word .
Perplexity : 2.584177545860253
Sentence: she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all .
Perplexity : 2.690579286298823
Sentence: in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .
Perplexity : 2.5109136167965374

Perplexity : 2.9533901333392003
Sentence: elizabeth 's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr. darcy and herself .
Perplexity : 2.7348666195959526
Sentence: she was sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister 's refusal must have given him .

Sentence: `` his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , '' said she ; `` and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . ''
Perplexity : 2.8532049757139206
Sentence: `` indeed , '' replied elizabeth , `` i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .

Sentence: what a stroke was this for poor jane !
Perplexity : 1.902818747578576

Sentence: most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .
Perplexity : 2.0545557233836442
Sentence: `` you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .
Perplexity : 3.1722175904551646
Sentence: take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .
Perplexity : 3.3764087462422867
Sentence: there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .
Perplexity : 2.6680859678367823
Sentence: for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr. darcy 's , but you shall do as you chuse . ''
Perplexity : 3.2039474843697158
Sentence: it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane .
Perplexity : 2.8596507945263454
Sentence: `` i do not know when i have been more shocked , '' said she .
Perplexity : 3.075726953502914
Sentence: `` wickham so very bad !
Perplexity : 2.6317390948737116
Sentence: and poor mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 2.5685933462350037
Sentence: dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .
Perplexity : 3.0970844590856808
Sentence: such a disappointment !
Perplexity : 3.327694181853999
Sentence: and having to relate such a thing of his sister !

Sentence: i am sure you must feel it so . ''
Perplexity : 3.267750421236738
Sentence: no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .
Perplexity : 2.971034035656957
Sentence: i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .
Perplexity : 2.4782843276413167

Sentence: `` poor wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !

Sentence: `` there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .
Perplexity : 2.5483781942954957
Sentence: one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . ''
Perplexity : 2.8168775621900553
Sentence: `` and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .
Perplexity : 2.509908427428693
Sentence: it is such a spur to one 's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .
Perplexity : 2.6644097720648223
Sentence: one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . ''
Perplexity : 2.4774196273662583
Sentence: `` lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . ''
Perplexity : 2.7423976829864363
Sentence: `` indeed i could not .
Perplexity : 4.58004245271124
Sentence: and with no one to speak to , of what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had !
Perplexity : 3.425842130341939
Sentence: `` how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved . ''
Perplexity : 2.5079922527866123
Sentence: `` certainly .
Perplexity : 4.258035337033433
Sentence: but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging .
Perplexity : 2.4979457324270697
Sentence: there is one point , on which i want your advice .
Perplexity : 3.4731687902895345
Sentence: i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham 's character . ''
Perplexity : 2.8381598351295656
Sentence: what is your own opinion ? ''
Perplexity : 3.370266456221105
Sentence: `` that it ought not to be attempted .
Perplexity : 3.107579661361592
Sentence: mr. darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .
Perplexity : 2.770257100676284
Sentence: on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?
Perplexity : 2.864512554838754
Sentence: i am not equal to it .
Perplexity : 3.7366568938076306
Sentence: wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .
Perplexity : 2.845946905999639
Sentence: sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .
Perplexity : 2.5800702062320715
Sentence: at present i will say nothing about it . ''
Perplexity : 2.683237956768232
Sentence: `` you are quite right .
Perplexity : 2.934194157042422
Sentence: to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .
Perplexity : 2.4945714873451914
Sentence: the tumult of elizabeth 's mind was allayed by this conversation .
Perplexity : 2.448292983061607
Sentence: she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .
Perplexity : 2.7490666964579513
Sentence: but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .
Perplexity : 2.1594173416207396
Sentence: she dared not relate the other half of mr. darcy 's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .
Perplexity : 2.582834784660894
Sentence: here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .
Perplexity : 2.3432507365211466
Sentence: the liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value ! ''
Perplexity : 2.3687084782386676

Perplexity : 4.281012937832814
Sentence: she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .
Perplexity : 2.3064800659005336
Sentence: having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .
Perplexity : 2.6824933418086
Sentence: `` well , lizzy , '' said mrs. bennet one day , `` what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane 's ?
Perplexity : 3.041536499896743
Sentence: for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .
Perplexity : 2.934708741046943
Sentence: i told my sister philips so the other day .
Perplexity : 2.9127911478010113
Sentence: but i can not find out that jane saw any thing of him in london .
Perplexity : 3.255523137219562
Sentence: well , he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .
Perplexity : 3.1712883888424677
Sentence: there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . ''
Perplexity : 3.1006925296853476
Sentence: `` i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more . ''
Perplexity : 3.040759885391972
Sentence: `` oh , well !
Perplexity : 3.973825462804441
Sentence: nobody wants him to come .
Perplexity : 2.935576389609127
Sentence: though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .
Perplexity : 3.3080073844154523
Sentence: well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . ''
Perplexity : 2.910438661563789
Sentence: but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .
Perplexity : 2.9430777891881035
Sentence: `` well , lizzy , '' continued her mother soon afterwards , `` and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ?
Perplexity : 3.132562024647559
Sentence: well , well , i only hope it will last .

Perplexity : 2.789804074927019
Sentence: there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , i dare say . ''
Perplexity : 2.3054609165568665

Perplexity : 2.795213800759693
Sentence: well , much good may it do them !
Perplexity : 2.7767384716191437
Sentence: they look upon it quite as their own , i dare say , whenever that happens . ''
Perplexity : 2.5158927129084354
Sentence: `` it was a subject which they could not mention before me . ''
Perplexity : 3.2609575989917814
Sentence: `` no .
Perplexity : 8.061785760606885
Sentence: it would have been strange if they had .
Perplexity : 3.0685768327028886
Sentence: but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .
Perplexity : 3.426358623580262
Sentence: the first week of their return was soon gone .
Perplexity : 3.059355752716228
Sentence: the second began .
Perplexity : 2.2552965026735476
Sentence: it was the last of the regiment 's stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .
Perplexity : 2.997860921013147
Sentence: the dejection was almost universal .
Perplexity : 1.8714202368174824
Sentence: the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .
Perplexity : 2.1280788728404816
Sentence: very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family .

Sentence: what are we to do ! ''
Perplexity : 2.944455826472949
Sentence: would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .
Perplexity : 1.7907508608935778
Sentence: their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .
Perplexity : 2.2864541775856293
Sentence: `` i am sure , '' said she , `` i cried for two days together when colonel millar 's regiment went away .

Perplexity : 3.5228953943593915
Sentence: every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .
Perplexity : 2.6151023765398445

Sentence: they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .
Perplexity : 2.54345443096379
Sentence: amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .
Perplexity : 2.8019272381906606
Sentence: nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .
Perplexity : 2.941796394149634

Sentence: or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?
Perplexity : 3.312007262781203

Sentence: she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .
Perplexity : 2.363402123430227

Sentence: she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .
Perplexity : 3.2011914963598924
Sentence: they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .
Perplexity : 2.6940272296650183
Sentence: her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr. darcy then was .
Perplexity : 3.036983961736423

Perplexity : 3.0262431460732464
Sentence: perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .
Perplexity : 3.0878932592927546
Sentence: whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .
Perplexity : 3.3275712940567264
Sentence: at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .
Perplexity : 2.540564526515874
Sentence: they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .
Perplexity : 2.216644571998023
Sentence: mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .
Perplexity : 2.8206178673540196
Sentence: with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .
Perplexity : 2.870293721199461
Sentence: they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it .
Perplexity : 2.22635097643961
Sentence: elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .
Perplexity : 2.5156356238515905
Sentence: her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .
Perplexity : 2.648251845797434
Sentence: whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth 's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .
Perplexity : 3.0643347952402924
Sentence: the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .
Perplexity : 2.8753469221871133
Sentence: for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .
Perplexity : 2.5962536727590266
Sentence: this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .
Perplexity : 2.4307828723560565
Sentence: with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words `` delightful , '' and `` charming , '' when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .
Perplexity : 2.7542960293651655
Sentence: her colour changed , and she said no more .
Perplexity : 3.042589054632109
Sentence: mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .
Perplexity : 3.0614572807799623
Sentence: this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .
Perplexity : 2.7589892416696733
Sentence: he takes them now for people of fashion . ''
Perplexity : 2.0512708735696585
Sentence: the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .
Perplexity : 2.6561423303208156
Sentence: elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .
Perplexity : 3.2205556089967544
Sentence: she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .
Perplexity : 2.707229877037334
Sentence: the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .
Perplexity : 2.4684107640340622
Sentence: mrs. gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .
Perplexity : 2.5890765716487008
Sentence: elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .
Perplexity : 2.951613096489088
Sentence: from what can it proceed ?
Perplexity : 3.246165722559582
Sentence: it can not be for me , it can not be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .
Perplexity : 3.3318359278340446
Sentence: my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .
Perplexity : 2.6148874533755686
Sentence: it is impossible that he should still love me . ''
Perplexity : 2.7536143310550094
Sentence: it originated in mrs. gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth 's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband 's .
Perplexity : 2.3716366456153
Sentence: mr. darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .
Perplexity : 2.971533248911315
Sentence: after a short silence , the lady first spoke .
Perplexity : 2.942103288655959
Sentence: `` they will join me early to morrow , '' he continued , `` and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , mr. bingley and his sisters . ''
Perplexity : 2.7066813855980407
Sentence: elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .
Perplexity : 2.1145960134591717
Sentence: her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingley 's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .
Perplexity : 2.988575888139577
Sentence: `` there is also one other person in the party , '' he continued after a pause , `` who more particularly wishes to be known to you , will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? ''
Perplexity : 3.0077831412020135
Sentence: she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .

Perplexity : 3.0911804237911666
Sentence: it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .
Perplexity : 2.725900365095235
Sentence: when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .

Perplexity : 3.1984573476273135
Sentence: they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant 's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for mr. darcy .

Sentence: neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight .
Perplexity : 2.567803116595295

Perplexity : 2.606960339997728

Sentence: she certainly did not hate him .
Perplexity : 2.2375736503371586

Perplexity : 2.416271449223918
Sentence: he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .
Perplexity : 2.4124765263423242
Sentence: she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .
Perplexity : 2.8085286236193165
Sentence: it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy 's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .

Perplexity : 2.425969522022368
Sentence: in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs. hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london .
Perplexity : 2.983938405202857
Sentence: georgiana 's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .
Perplexity : 2.6233103202319286
Sentence: mrs. gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .
Perplexity : 2.725697543884392
Sentence: by mrs. hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .
Perplexity : 2.4795186469221444
Sentence: elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .
Perplexity : 2.8833557000345778

Sentence: she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .

Sentence: she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .
Perplexity : 2.6425010709992716
Sentence: the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .
Perplexity : 2.3560530441048995
Sentence: there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .
Perplexity : 2.520735880646213
Sentence: no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .
Perplexity : 2.689021305441462
Sentence: in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley 's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over .
Perplexity : 2.6320786349762946
Sentence: miss darcy , on her brother 's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .

Sentence: they must be a great loss to your family . ''
Perplexity : 3.4689715818966604
Sentence: in darcy 's presence she dared not mention wickham 's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment 's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .
Perplexity : 2.3433536396830754
Sentence: while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .
Perplexity : 2.4491361499213946
Sentence: had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy 's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .
Perplexity : 2.618270086026387
Sentence: not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy 's meditated elopement .
Perplexity : 2.4520672023774006

Perplexity : 2.475750316592796
Sentence: her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .
Perplexity : 2.7728820427532
Sentence: their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress .
Perplexity : 2.6384119228630536
Sentence: but georgiana would not join her .
Perplexity : 2.22884644897521
Sentence: her brother 's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .
Perplexity : 2.4655113197430083
Sentence: when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .
Perplexity : 2.7356700444190722
Sentence: `` how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy , '' she cried ; `` i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .

Sentence: her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines .
Perplexity : 2.19579398032962
Sentence: her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .
Perplexity : 2.842184024627892
Sentence: they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . ''
Perplexity : 2.8096152887498946
Sentence: persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .
Perplexity : 2.876285358836711
Sentence: i should as soon call her mother a wit . '
Perplexity : 3.037554542409261
Sentence: but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . ''
Perplexity : 2.5760927906100375
Sentence: `` yes , '' replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , `` but that was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . ''
Perplexity : 3.0531988483662005

Perplexity : 2.444869541720956

Perplexity : 2.70521620228877
Sentence: an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr. gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn .

Sentence: `` i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , '' said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; `` and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .
Perplexity : 2.9950428565415383
Sentence: it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel 's family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best .

Sentence: `` upon my word , '' said mrs. gardiner , `` i begin to be of your uncle 's opinion .
Perplexity : 2.990612351738581
Sentence: can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? ''
Perplexity : 3.2501732838604496
Sentence: `` not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .
Perplexity : 2.449322420961138
Sentence: but of every other neglect i can believe him capable .
Perplexity : 3.0807551719397384
Sentence: if , indeed , it should be so !
Perplexity : 3.9678164889291754
Sentence: why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ? ''
Perplexity : 3.301358901844128
Sentence: `` in the first place , '' replied mr. gardiner , `` there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland . ''
Perplexity : 2.8335843605186266
Sentence: but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !
Perplexity : 2.098956124747445
Sentence: and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road . ''
Perplexity : 2.4725149584693753
Sentence: `` well , then supposing them to be in london .
Perplexity : 3.080472261927588
Sentence: they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .
Perplexity : 2.9028626015390024
Sentence: it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland . ''
Perplexity : 2.6995145658406945
Sentence: why any fear of detection ?
Perplexity : 1.6948027977380737
Sentence: why must their marriage be private ?

Perplexity : 2.7636107334230955

Perplexity : 2.5292764957922733
Sentence: as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .
Perplexity : 2.4720891296554397
Sentence: but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good .
Perplexity : 2.887503973804487
Sentence: lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father 's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . ''
Perplexity : 3.2276368227273653

Perplexity : 3.23075760101292
Sentence: but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is .

Perplexity : 2.710024287533079

Sentence: pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . ''

Sentence: elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .
Perplexity : 3.021785492227126

Perplexity : 2.760642919774426
Sentence: from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .
Perplexity : 2.7562889896907565
Sentence: the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .

Sentence: but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .
Perplexity : 3.4111926006470425

Perplexity : 2.933270561971543

Sentence: but mr. gardiner could not be seen , and mr. darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .
Perplexity : 3.168708830871061

Perplexity : 2.5390011112493323

Sentence: they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .
Perplexity : 2.7169681105626724
Sentence: but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .
Perplexity : 2.5971950709475946
Sentence: but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .
Perplexity : 3.020467496244429

Perplexity : 2.539856252575293

Perplexity : 2.9510878476946476
Sentence: perhaps there was some truth in this ; though i doubt whether his reserve , or anybody 's reserve , can be answerable for the event .
Perplexity : 2.7672872681652207
Sentence: but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .

Sentence: he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .

Perplexity : 2.752816064384233
Sentence: to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley .
Perplexity : 2.9428493215502285
Sentence: her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire .

Perplexity : 2.424495511582146
Sentence: and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment 's concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . ''

Sentence: `` and this is your real opinion !

Perplexity : 2.754909649941842

Perplexity : 3.0041465748429785
Sentence: she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you .
Perplexity : 3.0826058007073893
Sentence: i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 3.4663596260353953

Sentence: it was a rational scheme to be sure !
Perplexity : 2.9518435822850067
Sentence: but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .
Perplexity : 3.1724231510616185
Sentence: she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .
Perplexity : 2.769608723576794

Perplexity : 2.447525749308042
Sentence: in revolving lady catherine 's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .
Perplexity : 2.4013026938805013
Sentence: from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .
Perplexity : 2.8438353526474818
Sentence: she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
Perplexity : 2.9082695969442103
Sentence: with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .
Perplexity : 2.473911853815466
Sentence: if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .

Sentence: in that case he would return no more .
Perplexity : 2.901120399269091

Sentence: i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .
Perplexity : 2.530832369999409
Sentence: the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs. bennet 's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .
Perplexity : 2.752944927561082
Sentence: she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .
Perplexity : 3.135593381705187
Sentence: it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .

Sentence: `` have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ?
Perplexity : 2.9503406071228744

Sentence: `` mr. darcy , you see , is the man !
Perplexity : 4.166886502048295
Sentence: now , lizzy , i think i have surprised you .
Perplexity : 2.9380046610620303
Sentence: could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?
Perplexity : 2.5064203175189608

Perplexity : 2.787255155619964
Sentence: i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . ''

Sentence: `` mr. collins moreover adds , '' `` i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .

Sentence: i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .

Sentence: but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .
Perplexity : 2.928714106542641
Sentence: you are not going to be missish , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .
Perplexity : 2.3128932836862957

Sentence: `` yes that is what makes it amusing .
Perplexity : 2.8947080904272173
Sentence: had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !
Perplexity : 2.9625477302358063
Sentence: nay , when i read a letter of his , i can not help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law .
Perplexity : 2.756198005903693
Sentence: and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ?

Perplexity : 2.845187202281542
Sentence: elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .
Perplexity : 3.2327357436540343
Sentence: it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .
Perplexity : 2.8707326765985393
Sentence: her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr. darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .
Perplexity : 3.0480548382424177
Sentence: instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine 's visit .
Perplexity : 2.954619068228083
Sentence: the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out .
Perplexity : 2.993470209691014
Sentence: it was agreed to .
Perplexity : 2.8923942982974467
Sentence: mrs. bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .

Sentence: bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .
Perplexity : 2.5455804084280986
Sentence: they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other .
Perplexity : 3.018056655804231
Sentence: very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .
Perplexity : 2.7954578743278677
Sentence: now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , '' mr. darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding your 's .
Perplexity : 2.867200837717538
Sentence: i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .
Perplexity : 2.6008855859193742
Sentence: ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it .
Perplexity : 2.9047723194513746
Sentence: were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express . ''
Perplexity : 2.935060869686264
Sentence: `` i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , '' replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , `` that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .
Perplexity : 2.929531118730999
Sentence: i did not think mrs. gardiner was so little to be trusted . ''
Perplexity : 3.1733411397538474
Sentence: `` you must not blame my aunt .
Perplexity : 3.3832683238916417
Sentence: lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars .
Perplexity : 3.1537320609994888
Sentence: let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . ''
Perplexity : 2.6999437350833295
Sentence: `` if you will thank me , '' he replied , `` let it be for yourself alone .
Perplexity : 3.0480341419993575
Sentence: that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny .
Perplexity : 2.7032955994947714
Sentence: but your family owe me nothing .
Perplexity : 2.0618460425355187
Sentence: much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of you . ''

Perplexity : 2.5824321907603367
Sentence: if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once .
Perplexity : 2.5217716919450766
Sentence: my affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . ''
Perplexity : 2.5826152442790247
Sentence: the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .
Perplexity : 2.9109081511365575
Sentence: had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .
Perplexity : 2.8118589892587607
Sentence: they walked on , without knowing in what direction .
Perplexity : 2.7619359064466904
Sentence: there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .
Perplexity : 3.7089405325851694

Perplexity : 2.4016303653296807
Sentence: `` it taught me to hope , '' said he , `` as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .
Perplexity : 3.0274867533268814
Sentence: i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly . ''
Perplexity : 2.8872493677018145
Sentence: after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . ''
Perplexity : 2.8162123722899315
Sentence: `` what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ?
Perplexity : 3.3735139458650263
Sentence: for , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .
Perplexity : 2.511525317357647
Sentence: it was unpardonable .
Perplexity : 2.44962098471292
Sentence: `` we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , '' said elizabeth .
Perplexity : 2.5024427072064293

Perplexity : 1.7288476613877453
Sentence: you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice . ''
Perplexity : 2.9888240548277847
Sentence: `` i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .
Perplexity : 2.774117168820551
Sentence: `` i can easily believe it .
Perplexity : 3.0658306123331096
Sentence: you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did .
Perplexity : 2.425593250261323
Sentence: do not repeat what i then said .
Perplexity : 2.7500093088469963

Sentence: i hope you have destroyed the letter .
Perplexity : 2.7723549498668834
Sentence: there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again .
Perplexity : 2.70596753201082
Sentence: i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . ''
Perplexity : 2.101873553975417
Sentence: `` the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . ''
Perplexity : 2.698791630635286
Sentence: `` the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .
Perplexity : 2.8933419333432524
Sentence: the adieu is charity itself .
Perplexity : 1.5694637435591754

Sentence: `` i can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .
Perplexity : 3.0109568236910547
Sentence: your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .

Perplexity : 2.967477667103008

Perplexity : 2.646344787461764

Sentence: i always had a value for him .
Perplexity : 2.9628953920824137
Sentence: were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley 's friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me .
Perplexity : 3.3241285090732156
Sentence: but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .
Perplexity : 2.791349116388832
Sentence: how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton !
Perplexity : 3.1480831012954416
Sentence: i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you . ''

Sentence: elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .
Perplexity : 2.7984348910841876
Sentence: she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .

Sentence: all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .
Perplexity : 2.982282857203752

Sentence: what shall we do with him ?
Perplexity : 3.2454095582426326
Sentence: lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley 's way . ''
Perplexity : 3.615002854930691
Sentence: as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , `` mr. bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day ? ''
Perplexity : 2.8774047899250426
Sentence: `` i advise mr. darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , '' said mrs. bennet , `` to walk to oakham mount this morning .
Perplexity : 2.7996471474002247
Sentence: it is a nice long walk , and mr. darcy has never seen the view . ''
Perplexity : 2.858043611035943
Sentence: `` it may do very well for the others , '' replied mr. bingley ; `` but i am sure it will be too much for kitty .

Perplexity : 2.7858457663706755
Sentence: kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .
Perplexity : 2.596345031145769

Perplexity : 2.3633727865648173
Sentence: as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs. bennet followed her , saying , '' i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .
Perplexity : 3.089494325031328
Sentence: but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane 's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .
Perplexity : 3.2230543644351557
Sentence: so , do not put yourself to inconvenience . ''
Perplexity : 2.60472416865202
Sentence: during their walk , it was resolved that mr. bennet 's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .
Perplexity : 2.9163419155601464
Sentence: elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother 's .
Perplexity : 2.94474179406376
Sentence: she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .
Perplexity : 2.710629757405426
Sentence: but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .
Perplexity : 2.7103418527276197
Sentence: in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
Perplexity : 2.515942203150715
Sentence: she did not fear her father 's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .
Perplexity : 2.9870726647573163
Sentence: she was gone directly .
Perplexity : 3.1158329296867775
Sentence: her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .
Perplexity : 2.8610937674783354
Sentence: `` lizzy , '' said he , `` what are you doing ?
Perplexity : 2.858387474231589
Sentence: are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?
Perplexity : 2.7146727824903745
Sentence: have not you always hated him ? ''
Perplexity : 2.8371842598549923
Sentence: how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
Perplexity : 2.6040906566186615
Sentence: `` or in other words , you are determined to have him .
Perplexity : 2.806915173811886
Sentence: he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane .
Perplexity : 2.7766134976513954
Sentence: but will they make you happy ? ''
Perplexity : 1.956977836892689
Sentence: `` have you any other objection , '' said elizabeth , `` than your belief of my indifference ? ''
Perplexity : 2.75259696116495
Sentence: `` none at all .
Perplexity : 2.147914952842223
Sentence: we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . ''
Perplexity : 3.143949856344159
Sentence: `` i do , i do like him , '' she replied , with tears in her eyes , `` i love him .
Perplexity : 3.321945619397819
Sentence: he is perfectly amiable .
Perplexity : 2.939790268517293
Sentence: you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . ''
Perplexity : 2.9329660662439614
Sentence: `` lizzy , '' said her father , `` i have given him my consent .
Perplexity : 2.802769156579931
Sentence: he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .
Perplexity : 3.2026181912312373
Sentence: i now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .
Perplexity : 3.1347270041672286
Sentence: but let me advise you to think better of it .
Perplexity : 2.748813160687275
Sentence: i know your disposition , lizzy .
Perplexity : 3.404506337929992
Sentence: i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .
Perplexity : 2.9463790119095132
Sentence: your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .
Perplexity : 1.9994607416432781
Sentence: you could scarcely escape discredit and misery .
Perplexity : 2.133727313804469
Sentence: my child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .
Perplexity : 2.6433284601493234
Sentence: you know not what you are about . ''
Perplexity : 3.707075218706469
Sentence: elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
Perplexity : 2.5301050006259023
Sentence: `` well , my dear , '' said he , when she ceased speaking , `` i have no more to say .
Perplexity : 2.836292154075171
Sentence: if this be the case , he deserves you .
Perplexity : 2.2550628278484415
Sentence: i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy . ''
Perplexity : 3.1304838615349775
Sentence: `` this is an evening of wonders , indeed !
Perplexity : 2.7712764595460015
Sentence: and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow 's debts , and got him his commission !
Perplexity : 2.7074673939974754
Sentence: so much the better .
Perplexity : 3.106101715708044
Sentence: it will save me a world of trouble and economy .
Perplexity : 2.2627372521369913
Sentence: had it been your uncle 's doing , i must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .
Perplexity : 2.782709076633124
Sentence: i shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . ''
Perplexity : 2.802842460711828
Sentence: he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr. collins 's letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , `` if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure . ''
Perplexity : 3.1050344794557945
Sentence: elizabeth 's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour 's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .
Perplexity : 2.698309097304386
