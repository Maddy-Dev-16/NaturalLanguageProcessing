Sentence: the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .

Perplexity : 0.5527819802369368
Sentence: `` i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , '' said he , `` that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .

Perplexity : 0.6147007570019966
Sentence: elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .
Perplexity : 0.7802445437751279

Sentence: no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy .
Perplexity : 0.8955655883688534

Perplexity : 0.7190511674238342
Sentence: till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .

Perplexity : 0.5356290385414226
Sentence: but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcy 's pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr. denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , '' i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . ''
Perplexity : 0.5823006595684955
Sentence: this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .

Perplexity : 0.555065375127743
Sentence: but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .
Perplexity : 0.5689024290107015
Sentence: mr. collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .

Sentence: the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .
Perplexity : 0.9859602858137632

Sentence: they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .

Perplexity : 0.4108002143554963
Sentence: it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . ''

Perplexity : 0.6026461310532748
Sentence: they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman 's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .
Perplexity : 0.6083555654725314
Sentence: after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .

Perplexity : 0.6348207169084144
Sentence: but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet .
Perplexity : 0.6825851221926775
Sentence: he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday .

Sentence: in as short a time as mr. collins 's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .
Perplexity : 0.5930431173688433
Sentence: the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .

Perplexity : 0.6624741046165759

Perplexity : 0.7063147150004258
Sentence: but still he would be her husband .
Perplexity : 0.4892406627365375
Sentence: without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .
Perplexity : 0.7933101557322778
Sentence: elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .
Perplexity : 0.561748262515448
Sentence: she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr. collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .
Perplexity : 0.5755668449104444
Sentence: a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .
Perplexity : 0.6643146724418022
Sentence: as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs. bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .

Sentence: you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . ''
Perplexity : 0.7851013626247421
Sentence: `` my dear sir , '' replied mr. collins , `` i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship 's concurrence . ''
Perplexity : 0.5232579346900673
Sentence: `` you can not be too much on your guard .
Perplexity : 0.658588723318909

Sentence: as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth . ''
Perplexity : 0.6771740005218931

Perplexity : 0.7856721013056213
Sentence: mrs. bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .
Perplexity : 0.5766745771794064
Sentence: she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her 's , he might become a very agreeable companion .
Perplexity : 0.645407975848183
Sentence: but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .
Perplexity : 0.7223897958901212
Sentence: the possibility of mr. collins 's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , '' engaged to mr. collins !
Perplexity : 0.5960770004118949
Sentence: my dear charlotte , impossible ! ''
Perplexity : 0.6441621565572431
Sentence: the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , '' why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ?
Perplexity : 0.6670879657017473
Sentence: do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman 's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? ''
Perplexity : 0.571534126986926
Sentence: but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .
Perplexity : 0.5706767708143684
Sentence: `` i see what you are feeling , '' replied charlotte , `` you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you .

Sentence: elizabeth quietly answered `` undoubtedly ; '' and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .
Perplexity : 0.5412729402116723
Sentence: charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .
Perplexity : 0.5539271417380409
Sentence: the strangeness of mr. collins 's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .
Perplexity : 0.718124666739922
Sentence: she had always felt that charlotte 's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .
Perplexity : 0.6346052456811182
Sentence: and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .
Perplexity : 0.6569003240547411
Sentence: elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .
Perplexity : 0.6344260789954972
Sentence: with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , '' good lord !
Perplexity : 0.6406659125766809
Sentence: sir william , how can you tell such a story ?
Perplexity : 0.6821534351732327
Sentence: do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 0.5364120513305677
Sentence: nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william 's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .
Perplexity : 0.6476591713450955
Sentence: elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr. collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .
Perplexity : 0.6274964406919655
Sentence: mrs. bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .
Perplexity : 0.7538997547275381
Sentence: in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .
Perplexity : 0.5629358190524373
Sentence: two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .
Perplexity : 0.5265870732159145
Sentence: nothing could console and nothing appease her .
Perplexity : 0.6505519690063177
Sentence: nor did that day wear out her resentment .
Perplexity : 1.0555219259820006
Sentence: a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .
Perplexity : 0.6742045034190933
Sentence: mr. bennet 's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !
Perplexity : 0.5571265310218319
Sentence: jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .
Perplexity : 0.6662402498064378
Sentence: kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr. collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton .
Perplexity : 0.6868033461479764
Sentence: lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs. bennet 's sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .
Perplexity : 0.6841441673879644
Sentence: between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .
Perplexity : 0.6898488454427446
Sentence: her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .
Perplexity : 0.6788761305991984
Sentence: jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .
Perplexity : 0.6351344419532695
Sentence: the promised letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth 's abode in the family might have prompted .
Perplexity : 0.6732525350266639
Sentence: after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .
Perplexity : 0.6334178651550608
Sentence: on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .
Perplexity : 0.5464773422395462
Sentence: she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .
Perplexity : 0.6398209091335103
Sentence: even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .
Perplexity : 0.7574409636707651
Sentence: unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane 's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .
Perplexity : 0.6062904378387968
Sentence: the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .
Perplexity : 0.5726780195220669
Sentence: as for jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth 's ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .
Perplexity : 0.6145599650501855
Sentence: but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .
Perplexity : 0.6510546655092365
Sentence: mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .
Perplexity : 0.6464470541669969
Sentence: he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company .

Sentence: the sight of miss lucas was odious to her .
Perplexity : 0.5286204115361871
Sentence: whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr. bennet were dead .
Perplexity : 0.527291974106469
Sentence: she complained bitterly of all this to her husband .

Sentence: let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor . ''
Perplexity : 0.45637046477937426

Sentence: `` i should not be surprised , '' said darcy , `` if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . ''

Sentence: mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire .

Sentence: she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .
Perplexity : 0.5656857781974974
Sentence: they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .

Perplexity : 0.6134242388907106
Sentence: her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .
Perplexity : 0.5650404948590722

Perplexity : 0.6986531653946315
Sentence: with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words `` delightful , '' and `` charming , '' when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .

Sentence: her colour changed , and she said no more .
Perplexity : 0.35029734304452165

Perplexity : 0.5914182354079977
Sentence: but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .

Perplexity : 0.6215979137413761
Sentence: she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
Perplexity : 0.5970175803267627
Sentence: with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .
Perplexity : 0.7899353500474128

Perplexity : 0.5793041311637039
Sentence: the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs. bennet 's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .
