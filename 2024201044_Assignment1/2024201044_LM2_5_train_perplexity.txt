Perplexity : 5685395.949941793

Sentence: `` i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` did not you ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but that is one great difference between us .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: compliments always take you by surprise , and me never .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: what could be more natural than his asking you again ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: no thanks to his gallantry for that .

Sentence: `` dear lizzy ! ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` i know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: with your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: affectation of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body 's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: and so , you like this man 's sisters too , do you ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: their manners are not equal to his . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` certainly not ; at first .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .
Perplexity : 5409361.170829657
Sentence: mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: mr. bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941915
Sentence: mr. bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: he did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .
Perplexity : 5214981.722569505
Sentence: between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: on the strength of darcy 's regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: in understanding darcy was the superior .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .
Perplexity : 4829613.899668227
Sentence: miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .
Perplexity : 4975009.591729293
Sentence: within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king , during his mayoralty .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .
Perplexity : 4975009.591729293
Sentence: by nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at st. james 's had made him courteous .
Perplexity : 3843481.4423705344
Sentence: lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet .
Perplexity : 4829613.899668227
Sentence: they had several children .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty seven , was elizabeth 's intimate friend .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: `` you began the evening well , charlotte , '' said mrs. bennet with civil self command to miss lucas .
Perplexity : 3937363.4881987735
Sentence: `` yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: <s> <s> robinson . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mr. robinson 's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: and his answering immediately to the last question oh !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` upon my word !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , eliza , '' said charlotte .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` mr. darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?
Perplexity : 4535895.760035059
Sentence: <s> <s> poor eliza !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: to be only just tolerable . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` i beg you would not put it into lizzy 's head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mrs. long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` are you quite sure , ma'am ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: <s> <s> said jane .
Perplexity : 301641.6175438599
Sentence: `` i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` miss bingley told me , '' said jane , `` that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .
Perplexity : 2646346.574996213
Sentence: with them he is remarkably agreeable . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` i do not believe a word of it , my dear .
Perplexity : 3434724.956102275
Sentence: if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs. long .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: but i can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise . ''
Perplexity : 5084478.559662972
Sentence: `` i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long , '' said miss lucas , `` but i wish he had danced with eliza . ''
Perplexity : 5030654.46576192
Sentence: `` another time , lizzy , '' said her mother , `` i would not dance with him , if i were you . ''
Perplexity : 2408302.9579249704
Sentence: `` i believe , ma'am , i may safely promise you never to dance with him . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: one can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: if i may so express it , he has a right to be proud . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` that is very true , '' replied elizabeth , `` and i could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . ''
Perplexity : 2646375.317386751
Sentence: `` pride , '' observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , `` is a very common failing i believe .
Perplexity : 4975009.591729293
Sentence: by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .
Perplexity : 4169205.6261052815
Sentence: vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: a person may be proud without being vain .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` if i were as rich as mr. darcy , '' cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , `` i should not care how proud i was .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: `` then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , '' said mrs. bennet ; `` and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly . ''
Perplexity : 3938007.616348286
Sentence: the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: miss bennet 's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest .
Perplexity : 4522062.9089234285
Sentence: by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother 's admiration .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: it was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .
Perplexity : 5428258.541999657
Sentence: `` it may perhaps be pleasant , '' replied charlotte , `` to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .
Perplexity : 4758517.358759224
Sentence: if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .
Perplexity : 4102646.609882518
Sentence: in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . ''
Perplexity : 4943489.304786667
Sentence: `` but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` remember , eliza , that he does not know jane 's disposition as you do . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . ''
Perplexity : 4975009.591729293
Sentence: jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` your plan is a good one , '' replied elizabeth , `` where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it .
Perplexity : 4268881.226323687
Sentence: but these are not jane 's feelings ; she is not acting by design .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: as yet , she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: she has known him only a fortnight .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` not as you represent it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` well , '' said charlotte , `` i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .
Perplexity : 5030654.465761992
Sentence: happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: occupied in observing mr. bingley 's attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .
Perplexity : 5378968.834015433
Sentence: of this she was perfectly unaware ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .
Perplexity : 5137903.073055077
Sentence: he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: his doing so drew her notice .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: it was at sir william lucas 's , where a large party were assembled .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` what does mr. darcy mean , '' said she to charlotte , `` by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? ''
Perplexity : 4909047.5982954465
Sentence: `` that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer . ''
Perplexity : 2960516.6207910264
Sentence: he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , '' did not you think , mr. darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? ''
Perplexity : 5251628.224822639
Sentence: `` with great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` you are severe on us . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` it will be her turn soon to be teazed , '' said miss lucas .
Perplexity : 4451314.310685711
Sentence: `` i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` you are a very strange creature by way of a friend !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: on miss lucas 's persevering , however , she added , `` very well ; if it must be so , it must . ''
Perplexity : 4298396.579888224
Sentence: and gravely glancing at mr. darcy , `` there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and i shall keep mine to swell my song . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941824
Sentence: her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .
Perplexity : 5240063.673750268
Sentence: mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941855
Sentence: `` what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: there is nothing like dancing after all .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: every savage can dance . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: sir william only smiled .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` your friend performs delightfully ; '' he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group ; `` and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr .
Perplexity : 4353385.52595476
Sentence: `` you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .

Sentence: jane was by no means better .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941774

Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: miss bingley was engrossed by mr. darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr. hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .
Perplexity : 4909047.598295542

Sentence: `` to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764

Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , '' said bingley .
Perplexity : 4535895.760035059
Sentence: `` i am afraid , mr. darcy , '' observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , '' that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . ''
Perplexity : 4643132.724710089
Sentence: `` not at all , '' he replied ; `` they were brightened by the exercise . ''

Sentence: `` if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside , '' cried bingley , `` it would not make them one jot less agreeable . ''
Perplexity : 3832411.4470476243
Sentence: `` but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , '' replied darcy .

Perplexity : 5326248.128096925
Sentence: on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book .

Perplexity : 4871259.556489675
Sentence: she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .

Sentence: `` indeed i do not dare . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793

Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: elizabeth went away with her head full of him .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she could think of nothing but of mr. wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent .
Perplexity : 4815569.382535448
Sentence: lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and mr. collins , in describing the civility of mr. and mrs. philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr. wickham and herself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr. bingley 's regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham .
Perplexity : 4253719.243662912
Sentence: `` they have both , '' said she , `` been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .
Perplexity : 3407582.139359937
Sentence: interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` very true , indeed ; and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?
Perplexity : 5155273.777071902
Sentence: do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .
Perplexity : 3454788.7922965256
Sentence: my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr. darcy , to be treating his father 's favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for .
Perplexity : 4829613.899668227
Sentence: <s> it is impossible .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: <s> <s> no . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: besides , there was truth in his looks . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` it is difficult indeed it is distressing .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: one does not know what to think . ''
Perplexity : 1275683.900101254
Sentence: `` i beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . ''
Perplexity : 2259110.109966355
Sentence: but jane could think with certainty on only one point , that mr. bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday .
Perplexity : 5378968.834015433
Sentence: they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennet 's civilities .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr. wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr. darcy 's looks and behaviour .
Perplexity : 5348014.820959281
Sentence: the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` while i can have my mornings to myself , '' said she , `` it is enough .
Perplexity : 1879965.6227521747
Sentence: i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: elizabeth 's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley 's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening 's amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance .
Perplexity : 4810715.619986259
Sentence: `` i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , '' said he , `` that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . ''
Perplexity : 3850317.7014165837
Sentence: elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances : and to have mr. collins instead !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: her liveliness had been never worse timed .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: there was no help for it however .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mr. wickham 's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr. collins 's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: it now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941915
Sentence: elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: mr. collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia .
Perplexity : 5354695.86081365
Sentence: till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .
Perplexity : 4073964.40061068
Sentence: but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcy 's pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr. denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , '' i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . ''
Perplexity : 5173541.27469005
Sentence: this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .
Perplexity : 5328689.9055263
Sentence: attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .
Perplexity : 5240063.6737501845
Sentence: but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941864
Sentence: the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: mr. collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .
Perplexity : 4766993.376608872
Sentence: he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` i dare say you will find him very agreeable . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: that would be the greatest misfortune of all !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: do not wish me such an evil . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941864
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .
Perplexity : 4715987.630712331
Sentence: they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .
Perplexity : 5019678.615330003
Sentence: he replied , and was again silent .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: <s> `` very well .
Perplexity : 301641.6175438599
Sentence: that reply will do for the present .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: but now we may be silent . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: <s> <s> `` sometimes .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: one must speak a little , you know .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: `` are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` both , '' replied elizabeth archly ; `` for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , '' said he .
Perplexity : 1570564.0989341056
Sentence: `` how near it may be to mine , i can not pretend to say .
Perplexity : 4451314.310685711
Sentence: you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` i must not decide on my own performance . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton .
Perplexity : 4851786.88029092
Sentence: she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , `` when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . ''
Perplexity : 5186908.004005784
Sentence: the effect was immediate .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .
Perplexity : 5119356.550318751
Sentence: at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , '' mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: `` he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , '' replied elizabeth with emphasis , `` and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .
Perplexity : 3292908.8989259633
Sentence: at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr. darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .
Perplexity : 4797430.712519977
Sentence: such very superior dancing is not often seen .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: it is evident that you belong to the first circles .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: what congratulations will then flow in !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i appeal to mr. darcy : but let me not interrupt you , sir .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , '' sir william 's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . ''
Perplexity : 4329271.907576973
Sentence: `` i do not think we were speaking at all .
Perplexity : 3737484.197670833
Sentence: sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i can not imagine . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` what think you of books ? ''
Perplexity : 2728621.8474017684
Sentence: said he , smiling .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: <s> `` books oh !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: <s> <s> <s> no .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: we may compare our different opinions . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: said he , with a look of doubt .
Perplexity : 3160143.6509858426
Sentence: `` yes , always , '' she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , `` i remember hearing you once say , mr. darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .
Perplexity : 4705138.314508675
Sentence: you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its being created . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` i am , '' said he , with a firm voice .
Perplexity : 1912079.4817291982
Sentence: `` and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` i hope not . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` may i ask to what these questions tend ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` i am trying to make it out . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` and what is your success ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` i do not get on at all .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` i can readily believe , '' answered he gravely , `` that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . ''
Perplexity : 5243066.679346372
Sentence: `` but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , '' he coldly replied .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy 's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , '' so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr. darcy 's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner .
Perplexity : 5019678.615330003
Sentence: i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame , that he can not bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .
Perplexity : 4758517.358759351
Sentence: his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .
Perplexity : 4353385.525954775
Sentence: i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: `` excuse my interference .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: it was kindly meant . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` insolent girl ! ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: said elizabeth to herself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane 's being in the fairest way for happiness .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` i want to know , '' said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister 's , `` what you have learnt about mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 5245264.707026436
Sentence: but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` no , '' replied jane , `` i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you .
Perplexity : 3468891.9887156533
Sentence: mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister 's , mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
Perplexity : 5131857.305275167
Sentence: i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr. darcy 's regard . ''
Perplexity : 4732126.817358235
Sentence: `` mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself ? ''
Perplexity : 3737484.197670833
Sentence: `` no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i am perfectly satisfied .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: `` i have not a doubt of mr. bingley 's sincerity , '' said elizabeth warmly ; '' but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
Perplexity : 4535895.760035036
Sentence: mr. bingley 's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941864
Sentence: on their being joined by mr. bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr. collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
Perplexity : 5227362.172123757
Sentence: `` i have found out , '' said he , `` by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .
Perplexity : 3419446.407699687

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly !
Perplexity : 4732126.817358235
Sentence: i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .
Perplexity : 4829613.899668227
Sentence: my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` you are not going to introduce yourself to mr .
Perplexity : 3737484.197670833
Sentence: <s> <s> darcy ? ''
Perplexity : 52041.07999999999
Sentence: `` indeed i am .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night . ''
Perplexity : 3160143.650985837
Sentence: elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr. darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .
Perplexity : 5458189.88201926
Sentence: mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , '' my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .
Perplexity : 5197471.484221349
Sentence: you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . ''
Perplexity : 5341058.356922232
Sentence: and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr. collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: mr. collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr. darcy 's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .
Perplexity : 4959590.933776567
Sentence: mr. collins then returned to elizabeth .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine 's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .
Perplexity : 5240063.6737501845
Sentence: it was really a very handsome thought .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: upon the whole , i am much pleased with him . ''
Perplexity : 3938692.1179676843
Sentence: as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley 's two sisters .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: her mother 's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr. bingley .
Perplexity : 5426481.70925064
Sentence: it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane 's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941824
Sentence: she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .
Perplexity : 5003964.474366324
Sentence: in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother 's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy , who sat opposite to them .
Perplexity : 5361117.511169825
Sentence: `` what is mr. darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ?
Perplexity : 4609672.170600545
Sentence: i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` for heaven 's sake , madam , speak lower .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: what advantage can it be to you to offend mr. darcy ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: elizabeth now began to revive .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: elizabeth 's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .
Perplexity : 5208263.771483492
Sentence: mary 's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: elizabeth was in agonies .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , '' that will do extremely well , child .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: you have delighted us long enough .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father 's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: others of the party were now applied to .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` if i , '' said mr. collins , `` were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .
Perplexity : 4302115.542253792
Sentence: in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .
Perplexity : 4593095.920043608
Sentence: he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941824
Sentence: and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .
Perplexity : 4574001.595234319
Sentence: i can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: and with a bow to mr. darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: <s> <s> many stared .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .
Perplexity : 5333809.0850925315
Sentence: to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .
Perplexity : 5292447.794300633
Sentence: that his two sisters and mr. darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .
Perplexity : 5128520.641233807
Sentence: she was teazed by mr. collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .
Perplexity : 4829613.899668227
Sentence: he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .
Perplexity : 5301480.366087867
Sentence: there was no arguing upon such a project .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good naturedly engaged mr. collins 's conversation to herself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy 's farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham , and rejoiced in it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: mrs. hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .
Perplexity : 4975009.591729293
Sentence: they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins , who was complimenting mr. bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .
Perplexity : 5418195.349177383
Sentence: darcy said nothing at all .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mr. bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: mr. bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of `` lord , how tired i am ! ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: accompanied by a violent yawn .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: when at length they arose to take leave , mrs. bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months .
Perplexity : 5326248.128096944
Sentence: of having another daughter married to mr. collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .
Perplexity : 4943489.304786667
Sentence: elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: mr. collins made his declaration in form .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: on finding mrs. bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , '' may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? ''
Perplexity : 5409361.170829657
Sentence: before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs. bennet instantly answered , '' oh dear !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: <s> <s> yes certainly .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: come , kitty , i want you up stairs . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: and gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth called out , '' dear ma'am , do not go .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: i beg you will not go .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mr. collins must excuse me .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: i am going away myself . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` no , no , nonsense , lizzy .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i desire you will stay where you are . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: and upon elizabeth 's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , `` lizzy , i insist upon your staying and hearing mr .
Perplexity : 5119356.550318742
Sentence: <s> <s> collins . ''
Perplexity : 301641.6175438599
Sentence: mrs. bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr. collins began .
Perplexity : 2433966.531700248
Sentence: `` believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .
Perplexity : 2884961.5232625618
Sentence: you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother 's permission for this address .
Perplexity : 5171576.953968384
Sentence: you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did . ''
Perplexity : 4959590.933776567
Sentence: the idea of mr. collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : '' my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941834
Sentence: secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness .
Perplexity : 5318354.950897862
Sentence: twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! )
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille , while mrs. jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh 's foot stool , that she said , 'mr .
Perplexity : 4829613.899668227
Sentence: collins , you must marry .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: this is my advice .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her . '
Perplexity : 3753859.7066262118
Sentence: allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .
Perplexity : 4480850.865904365
Sentence: you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years .
Perplexity : 5195929.712073316
Sentence: this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .
Perplexity : 4871259.556489666
Sentence: and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: which will not be yours till after your mother 's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . ''

Sentence: accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . ''
Perplexity : 4298396.579888239
Sentence: `` i am not now to learn , '' replied mr. collins , with a formal wave of the hand , `` that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .
Perplexity : 5171576.9539685035
Sentence: i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` upon my word , sir , '' cried elizabeth , `` your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .
Perplexity : 2709603.8965012445
Sentence: you could not make me happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . ''
Perplexity : 4674581.673917957
Sentence: `` indeed , mr. collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say .
Perplexity : 4024658.311734069
Sentence: i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr. collins thus addressed her , '' when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . ''
Perplexity : 5534278.318874168
Sentence: `` really , mr. collins , '' cried elizabeth with some warmth , `` you puzzle me exceedingly .
Perplexity : 3843481.4423705274
Sentence: if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .
Perplexity : 4353385.525954767
Sentence: my reasons for believing it are briefly these : it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .
Perplexity : 4871259.556489753
Sentence: your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: `` i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .
Perplexity : 5003964.474366324
Sentence: i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .
Perplexity : 4943489.304786667
Sentence: my feelings in every respect forbid it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: can i speak plainer ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` you are uniformly charming ! ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; `` and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . ''
Perplexity : 4975364.122823012
Sentence: to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs. bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .
Perplexity : 5240063.673750268
Sentence: mr. collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: this information , however , startled mrs. bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .
Perplexity : 4959590.933776567
Sentence: `` but depend upon it , mr. collins , '' she added , `` that lizzy shall be brought to reason .
Perplexity : 1519225.7639139788
Sentence: she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will make her know it . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` pardon me for interrupting you , madam , '' cried mr. collins ; `` but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .
Perplexity : 5354695.86081365
Sentence: if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` sir , you quite misunderstand me , '' said mrs. bennet , alarmed .
Perplexity : 1699837.5534766244
Sentence: `` lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , '' oh !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . ''
Perplexity : 4758517.358759233
Sentence: mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .
Perplexity : 5137903.073055077
Sentence: `` i have not the pleasure of understanding you , '' said he , when she had finished her speech .
Perplexity : 1325680.8638028612
Sentence: `` of mr. collins and lizzy .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins , and mr. collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` and what am i to do on the occasion ?
Perplexity : 3737484.197670833
Sentence: it seems an hopeless business . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` speak to lizzy about it yourself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . ''
Perplexity : 1615164.1397848604
Sentence: `` let her be called down .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she shall hear my opinion . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mrs. bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` come here , child , '' cried her father as she appeared .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` i have sent for you on an affair of importance .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: i understand that mr. collins has made you an offer of marriage .
Perplexity : 2960516.6207910264
Sentence: is it true ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: elizabeth replied that it was .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` i have , sir . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: <s> `` very well .
Perplexity : 301641.6175438599
Sentence: we now come to the point .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: your mother insists upon your accepting it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: is not it so , mrs .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr. collins , and i will never see you again if you do . ''
Perplexity : 2047334.154232598
Sentence: elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs. bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .
Perplexity : 5186908.004005784
Sentence: `` what do you mean , mr. bennet , by talking in this way ?
Perplexity : 2456834.3892475427
Sentence: you promised me to insist upon her marrying him . ''
Perplexity : 1615164.1397848604
Sentence: first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . ''
Perplexity : 4535895.760035059
Sentence: she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: though her manner varied however , her determination never did .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: mr. collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother 's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , `` i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here !
Perplexity : 3938692.1179676563
Sentence: what do you think has happened this morning ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mr. collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him . ''
Perplexity : 4535895.760035059
Sentence: charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where mrs. bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .
Perplexity : 5445111.198544849
Sentence: `` pray do , my dear miss lucas , '' she added in a melancholy tone , '' for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . ''
Perplexity : 5282980.156447757
Sentence: charlotte 's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth .
Perplexity : 4102646.60988254
Sentence: `` aye , there she comes , '' continued mrs. bennet , `` looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way .
Perplexity : 4138984.0014299834
Sentence: i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you .
Perplexity : 4238710.642937215
Sentence: i have done with you from this very day .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .
Perplexity : 5078224.432167335
Sentence: people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: nobody can tell what i suffer !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but it is always so .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: those who do not complain are never pitied . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr. collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .
Perplexity : 5437990.584821016
Sentence: <s> <s> <s> mr .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: <s> <s> collins ! ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` my dear madam , '' replied he , `` let us be for ever silent on this point .
Perplexity : 3938692.1179676633
Sentence: far be it from me , '' he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , `` to resent the behaviour of your daughter .
Perplexity : 4404206.96837775
Sentence: perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941855
Sentence: you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .
Perplexity : 5172765.909776565
Sentence: my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: but we are all liable to error .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i have certainly meant well through the whole affair .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: the discussion of mr. collins 's offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .
Perplexity : 5354695.86081365
Sentence: mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt 's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` i found , '' said he , `` as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr. darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . ''
Perplexity : 4113650.4185539433
Sentence: she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941864
Sentence: his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .
Perplexity : 5171576.953968384
Sentence: soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately .
Perplexity : 2625206.6206167233
Sentence: the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady 's fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister 's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: the next was in these words .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley 's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .
Perplexity : 4753403.837335855
Sentence: but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: mr. bingley will not be detained in london by them . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: i will read it to you '' when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .
Perplexity : 4982476.220820789
Sentence: `` it is evident by this , '' added jane , `` that he comes back no more this winter . ''
Perplexity : 4419023.801088619
Sentence: `` it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: he is his own master .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but you do not know all .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: i will have no reserves from you . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` mr. darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941855
Sentence: i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .
Perplexity : 4783489.946203743
Sentence: my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister 's partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman 's heart .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? ''
Perplexity : 5227865.980584638
Sentence: `` what think you of this sentence , my dear lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 4102646.60988254
Sentence: `` is it not clear enough ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother 's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! )
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: to put me on my guard ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: can there be any other opinion on the subject ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` yes , there can ; for mine is totally different .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: will you hear it ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` you shall have it in few words .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: jane shook her head .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` indeed , jane , you ought to believe me .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: miss bingley i am sure can not .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: could she have seen half as much love in mr. darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: but the case is this .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way .
Perplexity : 5073899.93008578
Sentence: but , my dearest jane , you can not seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ''
Perplexity : 4534754.902380549
Sentence: but i know the foundation is unjust .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: believe her to be deceived by all means .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? ''
Perplexity : 4408639.493199941
Sentence: `` you must decide for yourself , '' said elizabeth , `` and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him . ''
Perplexity : 4056992.337479251
Sentence: `` how can you talk so ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: said jane faintly smiling , `` you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate . ''

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman 's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .
Perplexity : 5171576.9539685035

Perplexity : 5227865.980584638
Sentence: but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941824
Sentence: he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday .

Sentence: his reception however was of the most flattering kind .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: in as short a time as mr. collins 's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .
Perplexity : 4505550.975577493
Sentence: the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .

Sentence: her reflections were in general satisfactory .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mr. collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .

Sentence: but still he would be her husband .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845

Perplexity : 4775275.760781728

Sentence: as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs. bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941915
Sentence: `` my dear madam , '' he replied , `` this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . ''

Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` my dear sir , '' replied mr. collins , `` i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship 's concurrence . ''
Perplexity : 3823199.8959054574
Sentence: `` you can not be too much on your guard .
Perplexity : 2456959.5945172827

Sentence: `` believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire .

Sentence: as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .
Perplexity : 4829613.899668227
Sentence: mrs. bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her 's , he might become a very agreeable companion .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: the possibility of mr. collins 's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , '' engaged to mr. collins !
Perplexity : 4823070.766740951
Sentence: my dear charlotte , impossible ! ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .
Perplexity : 4909047.598295473

Sentence: i am not romantic you know .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr. collins 's character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . ''

Perplexity : 3938692.1179676703
Sentence: it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: she had always felt that charlotte 's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: charlotte the wife of mr. collins , was a most humiliating picture !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .
Perplexity : 5214981.722569505
Sentence: elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .
Perplexity : 4926658.389673669
Sentence: with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , '' good lord !
Perplexity : 5430435.135299613
Sentence: sir william , how can you tell such a story ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william 's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr. collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .
Perplexity : 5055334.97079742
Sentence: mrs. bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .
Perplexity : 5155772.536619047
Sentence: two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .
Perplexity : 5066991.187175591
Sentence: nor did that day wear out her resentment .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941824
Sentence: jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs. bennet 's sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: the promised letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth 's abode in the family might have prompted .
Perplexity : 5201351.297424288
Sentence: after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .
Perplexity : 5358041.184570266
Sentence: mr. collins 's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley 's continued absence .
Perplexity : 4943489.304786667
Sentence: even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane 's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .
Perplexity : 5137903.073055077
Sentence: the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: as for jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth 's ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941834
Sentence: but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941864
Sentence: mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: mrs. bennet was really in a most pitiable state .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr. bennet were dead .
Perplexity : 4871259.556489753
Sentence: she complained bitterly of all this to her husband .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` indeed , mr. bennet , '' said she , `` it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! ''
Perplexity : 2492659.1386906896
Sentence: `` my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .

Sentence: let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804

Sentence: if it was not for the entail i should not mind it . ''

Sentence: `` i should not mind any thing at all . ''
Perplexity : 3737484.197670833
Sentence: `` let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` i never can be thankful , mr. bennet , for any thing about the entail .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: why should he have it more than anybody else ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: miss bingley 's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother 's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941834
Sentence: hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .
Perplexity : 5214981.722569505
Sentence: miss darcy 's praise occupied the chief of it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793

Sentence: elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: to caroline 's assertion of her brother 's being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit .
Perplexity : 4609672.170600545
Sentence: had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister 's was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .
Perplexity : 5310107.174837584
Sentence: it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley 's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of jane 's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister 's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .
Perplexity : 5338289.497167509
Sentence: a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last on mrs. bennet 's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , '' oh !

Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men .

Sentence: it is very hard to think that she might have been mr. collins 's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .
Perplexity : 3684787.776212583

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: a young man , such as you describe mr. bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . ''
Perplexity : 5301480.366087867

Perplexity : 5685395.949941774

Sentence: pray , how violent was mr. bingley 's love ? ''

Sentence: at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: could there be finer symptoms ?

Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` i hope , '' added mrs. gardiner , `` that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .
Perplexity : 4871259.556489666
Sentence: we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . ''

Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: mr. darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month 's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , mr. bingley never stirs without him . ''

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` she will drop the acquaintance entirely . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley 's being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .
Perplexity : 4635816.6594664715
Sentence: it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane 's attractions .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: miss bennet accepted her aunt 's invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline 's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , mrs. gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth 's warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941864
Sentence: without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy 's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: on being made acquainted with the present mr. darcy 's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman 's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy .

Sentence: seriously , i would have you be on your guard .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804

Sentence: i have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: i see the imprudence of it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: that abominable mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: my father 's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and i should be miserable to forfeit it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: my father , however , is partial to mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?
Perplexity : 5376428.536321916
Sentence: all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing .

Sentence: at least , you should not remind your mother of inviting him . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` as i did the other day , '' said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; `` very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that .
Perplexity : 4478919.490798467
Sentence: but do not imagine that he is always here so often .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: you know my mother 's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784

Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte 's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .
Perplexity : 5310107.174837584
Sentence: sir william staid only a week at hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter 's being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941834
Sentence: while sir william was with them , mr. collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .
Perplexity : 5520876.360249886
Sentence: the room in which the ladies sat was backwards .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941855
Sentence: from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collins 's joints of meat were too large for her family .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941915
Sentence: the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941824
Sentence: their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses ' reach .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .
Perplexity : 5341058.356922232
Sentence: her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine 's curiosity .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr. darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley 's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself .
Perplexity : 5416040.232863916
Sentence: his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr. collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885

Sentence: mr. darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . ''
Perplexity : 4238710.642937215

Perplexity : 5685395.949941774

Perplexity : 3699439.399440798
Sentence: elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .
Perplexity : 3737484.197670833
Sentence: colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs. collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body .
Perplexity : 5341058.356922232
Sentence: at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family .

Sentence: have you never happened to see her there ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet .
Perplexity : 4616932.897582724
Sentence: the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: colonel fitzwilliam 's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen 's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905

Perplexity : 5685395.949941784

Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .
Perplexity : 5389816.7339272285
Sentence: colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mrs. collins 's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .
Perplexity : 4674581.673917973
Sentence: he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr. darcy .

Sentence: elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , '' you mean to frighten me , mr. darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?
Perplexity : 4719969.127461359
Sentence: but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .

Sentence: there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` i shall not say that you are mistaken , '' he replied , `` because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own . ''
Perplexity : 4415976.128038052
Sentence: elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , `` your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: indeed , mr. darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: `` i am not afraid of you , '' said he , smilingly .
Perplexity : 860731.4430307362

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793

Sentence: he danced only four dances !
Perplexity : 1309561.7704857436
Sentence: i am sorry to pain you but so it was .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804

Perplexity : 5119356.550318751
Sentence: `` true ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793

Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: my fingers wait your orders . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? ''

Sentence: said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: it is because he will not give himself the trouble . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` i certainly have not the talent which some people possess , '' said darcy , '' of conversing easily with those i have never seen before .
Perplexity : 4675486.225304445
Sentence: i can not catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` my fingers , '' said elizabeth , `` do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women 's do .
Perplexity : 3318107.165433674
Sentence: they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising .
Perplexity : 4829613.899668227
Sentence: it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman 's of superior execution . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: darcy smiled and said , `` you are perfectly right .
Perplexity : 3737484.197670833
Sentence: you have employed your time much better .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: we neither of us perform to strangers . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy , '' miss bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master .
Perplexity : 5262607.657196355
Sentence: anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin 's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth 's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship 's carriage was ready to take them all home .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , '' how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` perfectly so i thank you . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , '' i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ? ''
Perplexity : 5240063.6737501845
Sentence: he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: but perhaps mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . ''
Perplexity : 5214981.722569505
Sentence: `` i should not be surprised , '' said darcy , `` if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . ''
Perplexity : 3930351.473780706
Sentence: she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr. collins first came to hunsford . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: it is nearly fifty miles . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` and what is fifty miles of good road ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: little more than half a day 's journey .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: yes , i call it a very easy distance . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , '' cried elizabeth .
Perplexity : 4783489.946203761
Sentence: `` i should never have said mrs. collins was settled near her family . ''
Perplexity : 4353385.52595479
Sentence: `` it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , '' i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .
Perplexity : 5367294.5860982165
Sentence: where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: but that is not the case here .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , `` you can not have a right to such very strong local attachment .
Perplexity : 5003964.474366324
Sentence: you can not have been always at longbourn . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: <s> elizabeth looked surprised .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , '' are you pleased with kent ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .
Perplexity : 4387700.145985976
Sentence: the tte  tte surprised them .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .
Perplexity : 5099510.775022679
Sentence: `` what can be the meaning of this ! ''
Perplexity : 1309561.7704857413
Sentence: said charlotte , as soon as he was gone .
Perplexity : 1003154.3766142695
Sentence: `` my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . ''
Perplexity : 4626190.365480154
Sentence: but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte 's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: all field sports were over .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen can not be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam 's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .
Perplexity : 5301480.366087847
Sentence: but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: he seldom appeared really animated .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mrs. collins knew not what to make of him .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend 's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941834
Sentence: in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .
Perplexity : 5282980.156447757
Sentence: how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: yet it did , and even a third .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: it seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941834
Sentence: he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collins 's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too .
Perplexity : 5337471.464986279
Sentence: his words seemed to imply it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she was engaged one day as she walked , in re perusing jane 's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .
Perplexity : 5685395.9499418745

Sentence: `` no , i should have turned in a moment . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .

Sentence: `` do you certainly leave kent on saturday ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` yes if darcy does not put it off again .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: but i am at his disposal .

Sentence: he arranges the business just as he pleases . ''

Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` but so we all do .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .
Perplexity : 4975009.591729293
Sentence: `` in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .
Perplexity : 4609672.170600545
Sentence: now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` these are home questions and perhaps i can not say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: younger sons can not marry where they like . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: `` is this , '' thought elizabeth , `` meant for me ? ''
Perplexity : 2295075.439617761
Sentence: and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , `` and pray , what is the usual price of an earl 's younger son ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , '' i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .
Perplexity : 4871259.556489675
Sentence: i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . ''
Perplexity : 5119356.550318751
Sentence: `` no , '' said colonel fitzwilliam , `` that is an advantage which he must divide with me .

Sentence: i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` are you , indeed ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: and pray what sort of guardians do you make ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: does your charge give you much trouble ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . ''
Perplexity : 5137903.073055077
Sentence: as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: she directly replied , '' you need not be frightened .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .
Perplexity : 3659909.087210236
Sentence: she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs. hurst and miss bingley .
Perplexity : 4104570.75237607
Sentence: i think i have heard you say that you know them . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` i know them a little .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy 's . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant .
Perplexity : 4829613.899668227
Sentence: it was all conjecture . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady 's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . ''
Perplexity : 5214981.722569505
Sentence: `` you may depend upon my not mentioning it . ''
Perplexity : 1615164.1397848604
Sentence: `` and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . ''
Perplexity : 1496555.343028041
Sentence: `` he did not talk to me of his own arts , '' said fitzwilliam smiling .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .
Perplexity : 2784645.7057499886
Sentence: after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` i am thinking of what you have been telling me , '' said she .
Perplexity : 3844969.0462166537
Sentence: `` your cousin 's conduct does not suit my feelings .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: why was he to be the judge ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend 's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: `` but , '' she continued , recollecting herself , `` as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .
Perplexity : 4635899.389196233
Sentence: `` that is not an unnatural surmise , '' said fitzwilliam , `` but it is lessening the honour of my cousin 's triumph very sadly . ''
Perplexity : 4675486.225304445
Sentence: this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr. darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .
Perplexity : 5030654.46576192
Sentence: there could not exist in the world two men , over whom mr. darcy could have such boundless influence .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr. bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .
Perplexity : 5201351.297424288
Sentence: he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .
Perplexity : 5171576.953968384
Sentence: `` there were some very strong objections against the lady , '' were colonel fitzwilliam 's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london .
Perplexity : 3938692.1179676913
Sentence: all loveliness and goodness as she is !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr. darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend 's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941864
Sentence: mrs. collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr. collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine 's being rather displeased by her staying at home .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941855
Sentence: when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent .
Perplexity : 4890601.561836049
Sentence: they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: mr. darcy 's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister 's sufferings .
Perplexity : 4975009.591729293
Sentence: she could not think of darcy 's leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941864
Sentence: while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .
Perplexity : 5055334.970797518
Sentence: he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .
Perplexity : 3161272.6687062127
Sentence: after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , '' in vain have i struggled .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: it will not do .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: my feelings will not be repressed .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you . ''
Perplexity : 4451314.310685711
Sentence: she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .
Perplexity : 3737484.197670833
Sentence: he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .
Perplexity : 5119356.550318742
Sentence: his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , '' in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .
Perplexity : 5384490.4965093555
Sentence: it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: but i can not i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: mr. darcy , who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: the pause was to elizabeth 's feelings dreadful .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , '' and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: but it is of small importance . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but i have other provocations .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: you know i have .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: you dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: <s> <s> she repeated .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: with assumed tranquillity he then replied , `` i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success .
Perplexity : 5214981.722569505
Sentence: towards him i have been kinder than towards myself . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` but it is not merely this affair , '' she continued , `` on which my dislike is founded .
Perplexity : 2779498.4996462804
Sentence: long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` you take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns , '' said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` his misfortunes ! ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: repeated darcy contemptuously ; `` yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` and of your infliction , '' cried elizabeth with energy .
Perplexity : 3938692.1179676843
Sentence: `` you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .
Perplexity : 4535895.760035059
Sentence: you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: you have done all this !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: this is the estimation in which you hold me !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i thank you for explaining it so fully .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: but perhaps , '' added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , `` these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: they were natural and just .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , '' you are mistaken , mr. darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ''
Perplexity : 4609672.170600627
Sentence: she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , '' you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry . ''
Perplexity : 5512350.53331696
Sentence: `` you have said quite enough , madam .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: the tumult of her mind was now painfully great .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .
Perplexity : 4024658.311734069
Sentence: her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: that he should have been in love with her for so many months !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend 's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941834
Sentence: it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .
Perplexity : 4871259.556489675
Sentence: she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr. darcy 's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941824
Sentence: the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr. darcy , she was directly retreating .
Perplexity : 5097482.334601844
Sentence: she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy , she moved again towards the gate .

Perplexity : 5378968.834015433
Sentence: i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .

Perplexity : 5378968.834015433
Sentence: wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .
Perplexity : 5458189.88201926
Sentence: but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .

Sentence: if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your 's , i can only say that i am sorry .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784

Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: your sister i also watched .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening 's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941864
Sentence: if you have not been mistaken here , i must have been in an error .
Perplexity : 4451314.310685711
Sentence: your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .
Perplexity : 5003964.474366324
Sentence: but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister 's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .
Perplexity : 5140282.241021557
Sentence: that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ; i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941855
Sentence: but there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: these causes must be stated , though briefly .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: the situation of your mother 's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .

Sentence: <s> <s> pardon me .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: it pains me to offend you .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941834
Sentence: the part which i acted , is now to be explained .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804

Sentence: we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: i described , and enforced them earnestly .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister 's indifference .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: i can not blame myself for having done thus much .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: it is done , however , and it was done for the best .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: my father was not only fond of this young man 's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .
Perplexity : 5292447.794300633
Sentence: as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr. darcy could not have .
Perplexity : 5373240.792998264
Sentence: here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: it adds even another motive .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr. wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: the business was therefore soon settled .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: all connection between us seemed now dissolved .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941915
Sentence: you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: how he lived i know not .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941703
Sentence: she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941824
Sentence: regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: mr. wickham 's chief object was unquestionably my sister 's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: his revenge would have been complete indeed .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 5292447.794300633
Sentence: i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .
Perplexity : 5367294.5860982165
Sentence: if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .
Perplexity : 5100791.183630205
Sentence: i will only add , god bless you .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` fitzwilliam darcy . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: if elizabeth , when mr. darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: his belief of her sister 's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: it was all pride and insolence .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: this can not be !
Perplexity : 301641.6175438599
Sentence: this must be the grossest falsehood ! ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941824
Sentence: in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .
Perplexity : 5208263.771483492
Sentence: the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .
Perplexity : 4909047.598295473
Sentence: so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .
Perplexity : 4760793.1101441495
Sentence: but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham 's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941855
Sentence: she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: on both sides it was only assertion .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: again she read on .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr. wickham 's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .
Perplexity : 5273045.259851448
Sentence: of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself .

Sentence: his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: but no such recollection befriended her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin 's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .
Perplexity : 5221513.242465161
Sentence: at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin 's corroboration .
Perplexity : 4639931.973836533
Sentence: she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr. philips 's .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr. darcy 's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr. bingley , was incomprehensible .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941855
Sentence: she grew absolutely ashamed of herself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .
Perplexity : 4871259.556489666
Sentence: `` how despicably have i acted ! ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: <s> <s> she cried .
Perplexity : 60945.5448717949
Sentence: `` i , who have prided myself on my discernment !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: i , who have valued myself on my abilities !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: how humiliating is this discovery !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: yet , how just a humiliation !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: but vanity , not love , has been my folly .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: till this moment , i never knew myself . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: widely different was the effect of a second perusal .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister 's attachment ; and she could not help remembering what charlotte 's opinion had always been .
Perplexity : 4164364.2277269894
Sentence: neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: she felt that jane 's feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility .
Perplexity : 4674581.673917973
Sentence: when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: it is such a spur to one 's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .

Sentence: the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .
Perplexity : 5214981.722569505
Sentence: but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: she dared not relate the other half of mr. darcy 's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .

Sentence: she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .

Sentence: `` well , lizzy , '' said mrs. bennet one day , `` what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane 's ?

Sentence: well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . ''

Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .
Perplexity : 5271330.783121247
Sentence: she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia 's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .

Perplexity : 5367294.5860982165
Sentence: in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr. darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .
Perplexity : 5201351.297424288

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: how much of good or evil must be done by him !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941915
Sentence: when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: she had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr. darcy , the gardener 's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941855
Sentence: they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .
Perplexity : 4890601.561836049
Sentence: amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .
Perplexity : 5171576.953968384
Sentence: she was overpowered by shame and vexation .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: how strange must it appear to him !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !
Perplexity : 4238710.642937215
Sentence: it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: why did she come ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing 's park , when he put his letter into her hand !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .
Perplexity : 4767235.607155917
Sentence: she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .
Perplexity : 5214981.722569505
Sentence: perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .
Perplexity : 4216549.349136104
Sentence: they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941915
Sentence: mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .
Perplexity : 4849715.763973018
Sentence: her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .
Perplexity : 5292447.794300633
Sentence: whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth 's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .
Perplexity : 4157827.0606430704
Sentence: with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words `` delightful , '' and `` charming , '' when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941864
Sentence: her colour changed , and she said no more .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .
Perplexity : 5099510.775022679
Sentence: this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: `` what will be his surprise , '' thought she , `` when he knows who they are !
Perplexity : 3843481.4423705274
Sentence: he takes them now for people of fashion . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941864
Sentence: that he was surprised by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr. gardiner .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: mrs. gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .
Perplexity : 4354006.013411969
Sentence: elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , `` why is he so altered ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: from what can it proceed ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: it can not be for me , it can not be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .
Perplexity : 4024658.311734069
Sentence: my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: it is impossible that he should still love me . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941855
Sentence: it originated in mrs. gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth 's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband 's .
Perplexity : 5119356.550318751
Sentence: mr. darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: after a short silence , the lady first spoke .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected `` for your housekeeper , '' she added , `` informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . ''
Perplexity : 4450182.360506656
Sentence: he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .
Perplexity : 5186908.004005784
Sentence: elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .
Perplexity : 2728621.8474017684
Sentence: her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingley 's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` there is also one other person in the party , '' he continued after a pause , `` who more particularly wishes to be known to you , will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? ''
Perplexity : 4515850.772218879
Sentence: the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941864
Sentence: they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .
Perplexity : 4404206.968377766
Sentence: he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .
Perplexity : 4010847.9325425075
Sentence: she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784

Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: on mr. and mrs. gardiner 's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .
Perplexity : 4807155.552857138
Sentence: mr. darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774

Perplexity : 4667844.95453255
Sentence: `` he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , '' said her uncle .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` there is something a little stately in him to be sure , '' replied her aunt , `` but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .
Perplexity : 4807952.860404348
Sentence: i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , i have seen nothing of it . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .
Perplexity : 4758517.358759233
Sentence: `` but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , '' replied her uncle .

Sentence: fatigued as she had been by the morning 's walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance .
Perplexity : 5292447.794300633
Sentence: the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr. darcy 's civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941784

Perplexity : 5685395.949941885

Perplexity : 5186908.004005784
Sentence: there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .
Perplexity : 5051181.978658036
Sentence: never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941834

Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress .
Perplexity : 4940504.688634073
Sentence: but she had no reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiner 's curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941804

Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant 's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941864
Sentence: they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town , where the family did not visit .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .
Perplexity : 4783489.946203761

Perplexity : 5685395.949941915
Sentence: she certainly did not hate him .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793

Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .

Sentence: <s> it was gratitude .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .
Perplexity : 4829613.899668296
Sentence: she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .
Perplexity : 5451833.459750541
Sentence: it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy 's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .
Perplexity : 4546867.238223983
Sentence: they were , therefore , to go .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .
Perplexity : 4829613.899668227
Sentence: mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon .
Perplexity : 5003964.474366324
Sentence: convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley 's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady 's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed .
Perplexity : 4888613.981283954
Sentence: on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: georgiana 's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: mrs. gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: by mrs. hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .
Perplexity : 4924218.856328649
Sentence: it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .
Perplexity : 5378968.834015433
Sentence: miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .
Perplexity : 4150732.091337919
Sentence: this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .
Perplexity : 5227865.980584638
Sentence: her own thoughts were employing her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .
Perplexity : 5078224.432167335
Sentence: she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .
Perplexity : 5201351.297424426
Sentence: miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , '' pray , miss eliza , are not the shire militia removed from meryton ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: in darcy 's presence she dared not mention wickham 's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment 's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .
Perplexity : 4704194.470587553
Sentence: had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy 's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy 's meditated elopement .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: elizabeth 's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941834
Sentence: her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941834
Sentence: their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: but georgiana would not join her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: her brother 's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy , '' she cried ; `` i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .
Perplexity : 3564041.0940624434
Sentence: louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` for my own part , '' she rejoined , `` i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her .
Perplexity : 4909047.5982954465
Sentence: her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941834
Sentence: he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , '' i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , 'she a beauty !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941915
Sentence: i should as soon call her mother a wit . '
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` yes , '' replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , `` but that was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . ''
Perplexity : 4740929.321074418
Sentence: he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .
Perplexity : 5251628.224822639
Sentence: elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill. they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .
Perplexity : 5071286.901626924
Sentence: the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941824
Sentence: what i have to say relates to poor lydia .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793

Sentence: to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i am very , very sorry .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: so imprudent a match on both sides !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .

Sentence: lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , `` i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .
Perplexity : 5389816.7339270655

Perplexity : 5685395.949941855
Sentence: as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .
Perplexity : 5467101.325785164
Sentence: if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth 's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia 's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941845
Sentence: but now it was all too natural .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941885
Sentence: she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: how acutely did she now feel it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle 's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant 's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be deeply affected .
Perplexity : 4783489.946203761
Sentence: elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: they were to be off as soon as possible .

Sentence: `` and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: oh , that i knew how it was ! ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr. gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn .
Perplexity : 5194235.733821967
Sentence: it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel 's family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best .

Sentence: could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: his temptation is not adequate to the risk . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` do you really think so ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` upon my word , '' said mrs. gardiner , `` i begin to be of your uncle 's opinion .
Perplexity : 1392845.812401821
Sentence: it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .

Sentence: i can not think so very ill of wickham .
Perplexity : 3485104.5146149057
Sentence: can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? ''
Perplexity : 3485104.5146149057
Sentence: `` not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but of every other neglect i can believe him capable .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: if , indeed , it should be so !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but i dare not hope it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` in the first place , '' replied mr. gardiner , `` there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland . ''
Perplexity : 2504193.7017764165
Sentence: but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` well , then supposing them to be in london .
Perplexity : 3737484.197670833
Sentence: they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland . ''
Perplexity : 5227865.980584638
Sentence: `` but why all this secrecy ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: why any fear of detection ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: no , no , this is not likely .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: his most particular friend , you see by jane 's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: wickham will never marry a woman without some money .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father 's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . ''
Perplexity : 5426481.70925064
Sentence: `` but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: `` it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , '' replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , `` that a sister 's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .

Sentence: perhaps i am not doing her justice .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: since the shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall i call it ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: `` but you see that jane , '' said her aunt , `` does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . ''
Perplexity : 3679865.180440154
Sentence: `` of whom does jane ever think ill ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word .

Perplexity : 4871259.556489666
Sentence: but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .
Perplexity : 5469918.487542339
Sentence: but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .

Sentence: the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: perhaps there was some truth in this ; though i doubt whether his reserve , or anybody 's reserve , can be answerable for the event .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: i thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sister 's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !
Perplexity : 5186908.004005914
Sentence: he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941834

Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941864
Sentence: her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire .

Perplexity : 4667844.954532566

Sentence: it was a rational scheme to be sure !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .

Sentence: she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
Perplexity : 5685395.9499418745
Sentence: with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .

Sentence: instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine 's visit .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793

Perplexity : 5099510.775022679
Sentence: let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . ''

Sentence: elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941905
Sentence: had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .
Perplexity : 5194235.733821967
Sentence: they walked on , without knowing in what direction .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .

Sentence: i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764

Sentence: `` what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793

Sentence: <s> it was unpardonable .

Sentence: `` i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` i can easily believe it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did .
Perplexity : 4451314.310685711
Sentence: the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . ''

Sentence: do not repeat what i then said .

Sentence: `` the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . ''

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793

Perplexity : 5685395.949941774

Sentence: the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .
Perplexity : 5318354.950897862
Sentence: she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .

Sentence: at night she opened her heart to jane .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793

Sentence: that is all to be forgot .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` there can be no doubt of that .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793

Sentence: but are you pleased , jane ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` very , very much .

Sentence: `` what do you mean ? ''
Perplexity : 98535.60224543925
Sentence: `` why , i must confess , that i love him better than i do bingley .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: i am afraid you will be angry . ''

Sentence: will you tell me how long you have loved him ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` now i am quite happy , '' said she , `` for you will be as happy as myself .
Perplexity : 2796173.059445435
Sentence: i always had a value for him .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley 's friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me .
Perplexity : 5240063.673750175
Sentence: but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia 's marriage .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: `` good gracious ! ''
Perplexity : 301641.6175438599
Sentence: cried mrs. bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , `` if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley !
Perplexity : 5078224.432167335
Sentence: what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?
Perplexity : 4353385.52595479
Sentence: i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley 's way . ''
Perplexity : 4024658.311734083
Sentence: elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , `` mr. bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day ? ''
Perplexity : 5384490.4965093555
Sentence: `` i advise mr. darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , '' said mrs. bennet , `` to walk to oakham mount this morning .
Perplexity : 2486311.145347802
Sentence: it is a nice long walk , and mr. darcy has never seen the view . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: wont it , kitty ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane 's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .
Perplexity : 4106762.0383191896
Sentence: so , do not put yourself to inconvenience . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: during their walk , it was resolved that mr. bennet 's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .
Perplexity : 2710868.957722784
Sentence: elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother 's .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941895
Sentence: in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
Perplexity : 5119356.550318751
Sentence: she did not fear her father 's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , `` go to your father , he wants you in the library . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941814
Sentence: she was gone directly .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .
Perplexity : 4102646.60988254
Sentence: `` lizzy , '' said he , `` what are you doing ?
Perplexity : 477685.82264487195
Sentence: are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: have not you always hated him ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 5214981.722569505
Sentence: `` or in other words , you are determined to have him .
Perplexity : 4102646.60988254
Sentence: but will they make you happy ? ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` have you any other objection , '' said elizabeth , `` than your belief of my indifference ? ''
Perplexity : 2534867.449957285
Sentence: `` none at all .

Sentence: indeed he has no improper pride .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: he is perfectly amiable .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` lizzy , '' said her father , `` i have given him my consent .
Perplexity : 821395.6715179699
Sentence: he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: i now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: but let me advise you to think better of it .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: i know your disposition , lizzy .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: you could scarcely escape discredit and misery .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: my child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: you know not what you are about . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: `` well , my dear , '' said he , when she ceased speaking , `` i have no more to say .
Perplexity : 1004949.9742469825
Sentence: if this be the case , he deserves you .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy . ''
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: he heard her with astonishment .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: `` this is an evening of wonders , indeed !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow 's debts , and got him his commission !
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: so much the better .
Perplexity : 52041.07999999999
Sentence: it will save me a world of trouble and economy .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941804
Sentence: had it been your uncle 's doing , i must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941774
Sentence: elizabeth 's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour 's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .
Perplexity : 4955291.854718479
Sentence: when her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941784
Sentence: nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793

Perplexity : 5685395.949941764
Sentence: but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .

Perplexity : 5685395.949941793
Sentence: this was a sad omen of what her mother 's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for .
Perplexity : 5685395.949941855
Sentence: but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs. bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .
Perplexity : 5066991.187175591
