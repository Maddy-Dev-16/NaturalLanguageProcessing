Perplexity : 1991.053923514398
Sentence: elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .
Perplexity : 2071.2296835976003

Sentence: they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .
Perplexity : 2173.415756748882
Sentence: they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother 's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .

Perplexity : 2428.7183964152778
Sentence: his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs. hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .
Perplexity : 2274.701083273767

Perplexity : 2474.911913537412

Sentence: bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .
Perplexity : 2085.6669286193273
Sentence: darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .
Perplexity : 2330.3052738919373
Sentence: mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .

Sentence: if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs. long .
Perplexity : 1724.772135899404

Perplexity : 1661.9971329709874

Perplexity : 1677.2957977073572
Sentence: one can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .
Perplexity : 2071.98290276253
Sentence: if i may so express it , he has a right to be proud . ''
Perplexity : 2160.0741729931797
Sentence: `` pride , '' observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , `` is a very common failing i believe .
Perplexity : 2286.033541584893
Sentence: by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .
Perplexity : 1841.7828312521515
Sentence: vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously .

Sentence: the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield .
Perplexity : 2723.560803763731
Sentence: the visit was returned in due form .
Perplexity : 2619.019383552994
Sentence: miss bennet 's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest .
Perplexity : 2225.1769487199067
Sentence: by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother 's admiration .
Perplexity : 2154.2115727321047
Sentence: it was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .
Perplexity : 2083.6009384749677
Sentence: `` it may perhaps be pleasant , '' replied charlotte , `` to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .
Perplexity : 1658.7121205426981
Sentence: if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .

Sentence: there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .
Perplexity : 2164.509868880483
Sentence: we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .
Perplexity : 2439.0307615824236
Sentence: in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .
Perplexity : 2942.8056089659376
Sentence: bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . ''
Perplexity : 2190.4414836114543
Sentence: `` but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .
Perplexity : 2258.4111090876
Sentence: if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . ''
Perplexity : 2047.8077852074025
Sentence: `` remember , eliza , that he does not know jane 's disposition as you do . ''
Perplexity : 1657.7086221331033
Sentence: `` but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . ''
Perplexity : 1890.9299664139517
Sentence: `` perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .
Perplexity : 2155.4426815924007
Sentence: but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .
Perplexity : 2163.8060064888264
Sentence: jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .
Perplexity : 2439.281952159831
Sentence: when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . ''
Perplexity : 1938.216732265202
Sentence: `` your plan is a good one , '' replied elizabeth , `` where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it .
Perplexity : 1830.7480862007103
Sentence: but these are not jane 's feelings ; she is not acting by design .
Perplexity : 2708.1701086180715
Sentence: as yet , she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .
Perplexity : 2452.38456058534
Sentence: she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .
Perplexity : 2351.9526318131484
Sentence: this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . ''
Perplexity : 1647.4893147713822
Sentence: `` not as you represent it .
Perplexity : 2943.193815445202
Sentence: `` yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded . ''
Perplexity : 2263.9586295276354
Sentence: `` well , '' said charlotte , `` i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .
Perplexity : 1559.2207346031526
Sentence: if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .
Perplexity : 2342.7742939432437
Sentence: they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . ''
Perplexity : 2390.6071053530663
Sentence: `` you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .
Perplexity : 1753.8656607199337
Sentence: occupied in observing mr. bingley 's attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .
Perplexity : 1714.0699311540077
Sentence: mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .
Perplexity : 1939.599597708575
Sentence: but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .
Perplexity : 2341.808564734233
Sentence: to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .
Perplexity : 2939.9278380368846
Sentence: though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .
Perplexity : 2242.0403999271575
Sentence: of this she was perfectly unaware ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .
Perplexity : 2403.9662067276026
Sentence: he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .
Perplexity : 1914.8058660844993
Sentence: his doing so drew her notice .
Perplexity : 2939.1999727854145
Sentence: it was at sir william lucas 's , where a large party were assembled .
Perplexity : 2054.2000468836404
Sentence: `` that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer . ''
Perplexity : 1727.0382895036423
Sentence: `` but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about .
Perplexity : 2270.044205716793
Sentence: he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him . ''
Perplexity : 1544.8030881806721
Sentence: on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , '' did not you think , mr. darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? ''
Perplexity : 1945.8909089650401
Sentence: `` with great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . ''
Perplexity : 1917.7306309590176
Sentence: `` you are severe on us . ''
Perplexity : 1625.117184402486
Sentence: `` it will be her turn soon to be teazed , '' said miss lucas .
Perplexity : 1352.9461663910158
Sentence: always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !
Perplexity : 2535.37274553297
Sentence: if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . ''
Perplexity : 2086.635154114352
Sentence: on miss lucas 's persevering , however , she added , `` very well ; if it must be so , it must . ''
Perplexity : 1476.3203368805364
Sentence: and gravely glancing at mr. darcy , `` there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and i shall keep mine to swell my song . ''
Perplexity : 2351.09768079871
Sentence: her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .
Perplexity : 2158.5547684492476
Sentence: after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .
Perplexity : 2308.801564403215
Sentence: mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .
Perplexity : 2402.5041536625586
Sentence: elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .
Perplexity : 2131.000439720157
Sentence: mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began .
Perplexity : 2266.9160504344236
Sentence: `` what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr. darcy !

Sentence: every savage can dance . ''
Perplexity : 2656.1379743623124
Sentence: sir william only smiled .
Perplexity : 2945.4856771182563
Sentence: `` your friend performs delightfully ; '' he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group ; `` and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr .
Perplexity : 2144.008033593494
Sentence: darcy . ''
Perplexity : 842.7142857142858

Sentence: `` it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it . ''
Perplexity : 1809.766084228037
Sentence: `` you have a house in town , i conclude ? ''
Perplexity : 1765.8369698582833
Sentence: mr. darcy bowed .
Perplexity : 2993.4947803528903
Sentence: he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , '' my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing ?

Sentence: mrs. bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if mr. bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well .
Perplexity : 2209.819905277122
Sentence: against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow mr. bingley 's carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .

Sentence: he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .
Perplexity : 2725.2414716874323

Perplexity : 2344.9642005822616
Sentence: `` mr. collins , '' said she , `` speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . ''
Perplexity : 1454.1000436186248
Sentence: `` i believe her to be both in a great degree , '' replied wickham ; `` i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .
Perplexity : 1597.8313236295935
Sentence: she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . ''
Perplexity : 2415.950680301653

Sentence: she could think of nothing but of mr. wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent .
Perplexity : 1954.6201728282342
Sentence: lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and mr. collins , in describing the civility of mr. and mrs. philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house .
Perplexity : 2152.857912121737
Sentence: elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr. wickham and herself .
Perplexity : 1627.453745207572
Sentence: the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .
Perplexity : 2207.0190645365533
Sentence: `` they have both , '' said she , `` been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .

Sentence: do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . ''
Perplexity : 2177.215357615466
Sentence: my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr. darcy , to be treating his father 's favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for .
Perplexity : 2013.4254139317716
Sentence: it is impossible .

Sentence: no . ''
Perplexity : 2940.0

Perplexity : 1836.2208128379634
Sentence: the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .

Sentence: the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .
Perplexity : 1995.7531349636563
Sentence: mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .
Perplexity : 2207.497842823442
Sentence: jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr. wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr. darcy 's looks and behaviour .

Perplexity : 2531.382275825071
Sentence: society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body . ''
Perplexity : 2280.6854995690273
Sentence: elizabeth 's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley 's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening 's amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance .
Perplexity : 1728.6112573268642
Sentence: elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .
Perplexity : 2711.642083391585

Sentence: there was no help for it however .
Perplexity : 2158.5439282695966
Sentence: she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .
Perplexity : 2360.3549785083082
Sentence: the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .
Perplexity : 2251.012974411414
Sentence: elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .
Perplexity : 2496.4359774376876
Sentence: mr. collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .
Perplexity : 2238.4662364770193
Sentence: even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia .
Perplexity : 2434.511788452993
Sentence: till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .
Perplexity : 2381.2882050586677
Sentence: the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .
Perplexity : 2531.8301735389164
Sentence: but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcy 's pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr. denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , '' i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . ''
Perplexity : 2009.4786917533158
Sentence: this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .
Perplexity : 2451.9054051296735
Sentence: attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .
Perplexity : 2768.887605017445
Sentence: but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .
Perplexity : 2136.3812528665694
Sentence: the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .
Perplexity : 2365.234709393193
Sentence: the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .
Perplexity : 2954.1480335655842
Sentence: she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .
Perplexity : 1933.8276764769978
Sentence: when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .
Perplexity : 1857.7421244858315
Sentence: he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her .
Perplexity : 2114.830511364163
Sentence: `` i dare say you will find him very agreeable . ''
Perplexity : 1795.4702953521435
Sentence: `` heaven forbid !
Perplexity : 2399.887566810855
Sentence: that would be the greatest misfortune of all !
Perplexity : 2284.936004826155
Sentence: do not wish me such an evil . ''
Perplexity : 2479.4000775176864
Sentence: when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .
Perplexity : 2014.1042445567887
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .
Perplexity : 2093.1079740564687
Sentence: they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .
Perplexity : 2143.9467629061323
Sentence: he replied , and was again silent .
Perplexity : 1455.6170350768755
Sentence: i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . ''
Perplexity : 1987.822083242951
Sentence: that reply will do for the present .
Perplexity : 1995.4348744542883
Sentence: but now we may be silent . ''
Perplexity : 2751.929598158278
Sentence: `` do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? ''
Perplexity : 2537.655674219174
Sentence: one must speak a little , you know .
Perplexity : 1730.7686372461665
Sentence: it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . ''
Perplexity : 1968.0890593888084
Sentence: we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . ''
Perplexity : 2517.5082719746356
Sentence: `` how near it may be to mine , i can not pretend to say .
Perplexity : 1663.4867030005892
Sentence: `` i must not decide on my own performance . ''
Perplexity : 2422.3650779659147
Sentence: he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton .
Perplexity : 1838.448149648164
Sentence: she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , `` when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . ''
Perplexity : 2099.5007783066617
Sentence: the effect was immediate .
Perplexity : 2939.6665155007972
Sentence: a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .
Perplexity : 1973.3853641172675
Sentence: `` he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , '' replied elizabeth with emphasis , `` and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . ''
Perplexity : 1863.6264809121838
Sentence: darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .
Perplexity : 1581.1553195613456
Sentence: at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr. darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .
Perplexity : 2173.0083357985113
Sentence: such very superior dancing is not often seen .
Perplexity : 2944.053757681085
Sentence: it is evident that you belong to the first circles .
Perplexity : 2834.5811469280175
Sentence: allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley , ) shall take place .
Perplexity : 1833.3578959003728
Sentence: what congratulations will then flow in !
Perplexity : 2939.299938773427
Sentence: i appeal to mr. darcy : but let me not interrupt you , sir .
Perplexity : 2136.0744907526177
Sentence: you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . ''
Perplexity : 2408.3860433632613
Sentence: the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william 's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together .
Perplexity : 2311.8015499317353
Sentence: `` i do not think we were speaking at all .
Perplexity : 1001.6937027912844
Sentence: sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .
Perplexity : 2310.1472233226596
Sentence: we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i can not imagine . ''
Perplexity : 2056.9889959446323
Sentence: `` what think you of books ? ''
Perplexity : 2402.5387069848134
Sentence: said he , smiling .
Perplexity : 1096.0581444436764
Sentence: `` books oh !
Perplexity : 2939.0
Sentence: `` no i can not talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of something else . ''
Perplexity : 2190.1327769901877
Sentence: `` the present always occupies you in such scenes does it ? ''
Perplexity : 2625.5991655232583
Sentence: said he , with a look of doubt .
Perplexity : 977.4936805809272
Sentence: `` yes , always , '' she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , `` i remember hearing you once say , mr. darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .
Perplexity : 1759.2789815417987
Sentence: you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its being created . ''
Perplexity : 1639.6913742015786
Sentence: `` i am , '' said he , with a firm voice .
Perplexity : 660.3235927357924
Sentence: `` and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? ''
Perplexity : 2961.3474762534324
Sentence: `` i hope not . ''
Perplexity : 1389.9337720230733
Sentence: `` it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . ''
Perplexity : 2236.975916532762
Sentence: `` may i ask to what these questions tend ? ''
Perplexity : 2722.3281763271193
Sentence: `` merely to the illustration of your character , '' said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .
Perplexity : 1630.1518603386714
Sentence: `` i am trying to make it out . ''
Perplexity : 1287.8811916204397
Sentence: `` and what is your success ? ''
Perplexity : 1900.1336500235811
Sentence: she shook her head .
Perplexity : 1502.3919785316034
Sentence: `` i do not get on at all .
Perplexity : 1007.0265708005509
Sentence: `` but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity . ''
Perplexity : 1928.6999103321546
Sentence: `` i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , '' he coldly replied .
Perplexity : 1959.7896249191215
Sentence: she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy 's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .
Perplexity : 2296.9330694335135
Sentence: your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr. darcy 's steward .
Perplexity : 1790.7388379866836
Sentence: let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr. darcy 's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner .
Perplexity : 1933.2813020164015
Sentence: i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame , that he can not bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .
Perplexity : 1516.6448374328033
Sentence: his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .
Perplexity : 1714.1018865296282
Sentence: i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ''
Perplexity : 2512.445505241271
Sentence: `` his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , '' said elizabeth angrily ; `` for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcy 's steward , and of that , i can assure you , he informed me himself . ''
Perplexity : 1692.1366813621848
Sentence: `` i beg your pardon , '' replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .
Perplexity : 1631.7073279282815
Sentence: `` excuse my interference .
Perplexity : 2939.16665721612
Sentence: it was kindly meant . ''
Perplexity : 2964.422591876376
Sentence: `` insolent girl ! ''
Perplexity : 2939.333295534724
Sentence: said elizabeth to herself .
Perplexity : 1857.644031769612
Sentence: `` you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .
Perplexity : 2388.899056544942
Sentence: i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr .
Perplexity : 2945.3786589008787
Sentence: darcy . ''
Perplexity : 842.7142857142858
Sentence: she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley .
Perplexity : 2198.5202234753965
Sentence: elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane 's being in the fairest way for happiness .
Perplexity : 2083.9941879098055
Sentence: `` i want to know , '' said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister 's , `` what you have learnt about mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 1363.582518755381
Sentence: but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ''
Perplexity : 2320.3537908706912
Sentence: `` no , '' replied jane , `` i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you .
Perplexity : 869.2940581821724
Sentence: mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister 's , mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
Perplexity : 1928.6351169596085
Sentence: i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr. darcy 's regard . ''
Perplexity : 1755.322362658653
Sentence: `` mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself ? ''
Perplexity : 2173.018952755841
Sentence: `` no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton . ''
Perplexity : 2623.0291266500994
Sentence: `` this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 2047.7893351640569
Sentence: i am perfectly satisfied .
Perplexity : 2067.5436623334076
Sentence: `` he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only . ''
Perplexity : 2076.612146856062
Sentence: mr. bingley 's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before . ''
Perplexity : 2140.070513820646

Sentence: it was an animating subject , and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .
Perplexity : 2298.1322363572936
Sentence: his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .
Perplexity : 1974.368476686872
Sentence: it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane 's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .

Perplexity : 2297.7993069798213
Sentence: by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .
Perplexity : 2135.0512052462864
Sentence: elizabeth 's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .

Perplexity : 2716.688266904085
Sentence: let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . ''
Perplexity : 2814.3015561299835
Sentence: mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father 's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .
Perplexity : 2158.2947871934925
Sentence: others of the party were now applied to .
Perplexity : 2248.143958449592
Sentence: i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .

Sentence: many stared .
Perplexity : 2939.0

Perplexity : 2237.8437210644115
Sentence: to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .
Perplexity : 2174.9602541517147
Sentence: that his two sisters and mr. darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .
Perplexity : 1746.1809862981715

Perplexity : 2155.7195625939494
Sentence: they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins , who was complimenting mr. bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .

Perplexity : 2142.3213761839083
Sentence: mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months .
Perplexity : 2260.4982698324097

Sentence: my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .

Perplexity : 2636.488406931576
Sentence: i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .
Perplexity : 2189.0144154104255
Sentence: my feelings in every respect forbid it .
Perplexity : 2231.470700594777
Sentence: can i speak plainer ?
Perplexity : 2940.1664871705775

Perplexity : 2113.3985410275704
Sentence: to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .
Perplexity : 2473.2116052363276
Sentence: mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs. bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .
Perplexity : 2285.315332923026
Sentence: mr. collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .
Perplexity : 2442.8989360280825
Sentence: this information , however , startled mrs. bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .

Sentence: i will speak to her about it myself directly .
Perplexity : 2668.867498655456
Sentence: she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will make her know it . ''
Perplexity : 1719.519049141642
Sentence: `` pardon me for interrupting you , madam , '' cried mr. collins ; `` but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .
Perplexity : 2080.7599351251
Sentence: if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . ''
Perplexity : 2430.831560505266
Sentence: `` sir , you quite misunderstand me , '' said mrs. bennet , alarmed .
Perplexity : 1121.226886717789
Sentence: in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .

Perplexity : 2026.52959473835
Sentence: mr. bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar .
Perplexity : 2169.852275091173
Sentence: you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . ''
Perplexity : 1667.6016585379834
Sentence: mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .
Perplexity : 2348.087638332247
Sentence: `` i have not the pleasure of understanding you , '' said he , when she had finished her speech .
Perplexity : 827.7312175642219
Sentence: `` of what are you talking ? ''
Perplexity : 2208.637775017803
Sentence: `` of mr. collins and lizzy .
Perplexity : 1693.2110354519516
Sentence: lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins , and mr. collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy . ''
Perplexity : 1415.1438833176157
Sentence: `` and what am i to do on the occasion ?
Perplexity : 1864.710662961981
Sentence: it seems an hopeless business . ''
Perplexity : 2711.1813426741523
Sentence: `` speak to lizzy about it yourself .

Sentence: i understand that mr. collins has made you an offer of marriage .

Sentence: is it true ? ''
Perplexity : 2940.9989520080403
Sentence: elizabeth replied that it was .
Perplexity : 1491.7162812552215
Sentence: `` very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? ''
Perplexity : 2440.3853344044937
Sentence: `` i have , sir . ''
Perplexity : 1075.4431247196467

Sentence: `` yes , or i will never see her again . ''
Perplexity : 1589.8643946630787
Sentence: `` an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth .
Perplexity : 2662.714745292989
Sentence: from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .
Perplexity : 1889.7483401618763
Sentence: your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr. collins , and i will never see you again if you do . ''
Perplexity : 1322.70829702725
Sentence: elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs. bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .
Perplexity : 1782.8665507087267
Sentence: you promised me to insist upon her marrying him . ''
Perplexity : 1784.5626583705332
Sentence: `` my dear , '' replied her husband , `` i have two small favours to request .
Perplexity : 964.3169227632752
Sentence: first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room .
Perplexity : 2367.0137426811
Sentence: not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs. bennet give up the point .
Perplexity : 1562.8177365729455
Sentence: she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns .
Perplexity : 2432.623185262758
Sentence: she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ; and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .
Perplexity : 2676.4971061003025
Sentence: though her manner varied however , her determination never did .
Perplexity : 2946.6883394060483
Sentence: mr. collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .
Perplexity : 1953.460099075595
Sentence: he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .
Perplexity : 2464.6885986405737
Sentence: his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother 's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .
Perplexity : 2216.474742250194
Sentence: while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them .
Perplexity : 2496.0711669261086

Perplexity : 1492.8332312227742
Sentence: charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where mrs. bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .
Perplexity : 2096.6528254387235
Sentence: charlotte 's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth .
Perplexity : 2127.7492950173287
Sentence: `` aye , there she comes , '' continued mrs. bennet , `` looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way .
Perplexity : 2175.472015648887
Sentence: but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .
Perplexity : 1889.2346855649057
Sentence: i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you .
Perplexity : 1612.3034344913085

Sentence: i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .
Perplexity : 2056.8849606668564
Sentence: people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .

Sentence: nobody can tell what i suffer !
Perplexity : 2714.0323305115066
Sentence: but it is always so .
Perplexity : 1712.3257096502796
Sentence: those who do not complain are never pitied . ''
Perplexity : 2800.600799972219
Sentence: her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .
Perplexity : 2788.7173804554955
Sentence: she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr. collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , '' now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr. collins and me have a little conversation together . ''
Perplexity : 2037.4346929551912
Sentence: elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr. collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .
Perplexity : 2201.3040336945483
Sentence: in a doleful voice mrs. bennet thus began the projected conversation .
Perplexity : 2950.908532524967
Sentence: <s> mr .
Perplexity : 2939.0
Sentence: collins ! ''
Perplexity : 2940.0
Sentence: `` my dear madam , '' replied he , `` let us be for ever silent on this point .
Perplexity : 1321.8909997187059
Sentence: far be it from me , '' he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , `` to resent the behaviour of your daughter .
Perplexity : 2121.26736201887
Sentence: perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .
Perplexity : 2642.449967219464
Sentence: you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .
Perplexity : 2130.370228395645
Sentence: my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own .

Sentence: i have certainly meant well through the whole affair .
Perplexity : 2669.079765488891
Sentence: my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise . ''
Perplexity : 2416.146972426238
Sentence: the discussion of mr. collins 's offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .
Perplexity : 1913.917279281712
Sentence: as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .
Perplexity : 2740.744116361742
Sentence: he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .
Perplexity : 1563.4924251566931
Sentence: the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennet 's ill humour or ill health .
Perplexity : 2358.2354015126407
Sentence: elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .
Perplexity : 2279.7310204025252
Sentence: he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay .
Perplexity : 2219.263465911704

Perplexity : 2446.089038963155
Sentence: he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt 's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .
Perplexity : 2285.528289078447
Sentence: to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed .
Perplexity : 1713.9382961218623
Sentence: `` i found , '' said he , `` as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr. darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . ''
Perplexity : 1642.340668247019
Sentence: she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .
Perplexity : 2170.206341547047
Sentence: his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .
Perplexity : 2062.800581017828
Sentence: the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady 's fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister 's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .
Perplexity : 2347.4280801188934
Sentence: jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .
Perplexity : 2422.897175537429
Sentence: the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again .
Perplexity : 2043.9323265388127

Perplexity : 2664.0141403825446
Sentence: the next was in these words .
Perplexity : 2505.8575371180405
Sentence: `` i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .
Perplexity : 2236.1884121540843
Sentence: i depend on you for that . ''
Perplexity : 2449.5454223054235
Sentence: `` it is unlucky , '' said she , after a short pause , `` that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .
Perplexity : 1019.1127851794012
Sentence: but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?
Perplexity : 2572.865495806271
Sentence: mr. bingley will not be detained in london by them . ''

Sentence: i will read it to you '' when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .
Perplexity : 2135.8383178521685
Sentence: many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i despair .
Perplexity : 2180.7082210096783
Sentence: i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you . ''

Sentence: `` mr. darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .
Perplexity : 1817.4874259824003
Sentence: i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .
Perplexity : 2522.283136279692
Sentence: i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .
Perplexity : 1553.3061799744307
Sentence: my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister 's partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman 's heart .
Perplexity : 2252.934202638018
Sentence: with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? ''

Sentence: said jane as she finished it .
Perplexity : 2312.212517964484
Sentence: `` is it not clear enough ?
Perplexity : 2561.0717936135065
Sentence: does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother 's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! )
Perplexity : 2146.3898322238865
Sentence: to put me on my guard ?
Perplexity : 2941.598685027975
Sentence: can there be any other opinion on the subject ? ''

Sentence: miss bingley i am sure can not .
Perplexity : 1511.522881292531
Sentence: she is not such a simpleton .
Perplexity : 2245.474171570884
Sentence: could she have seen half as much love in mr. darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .
Perplexity : 2286.510518381992
Sentence: we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way .
Perplexity : 2038.627733751673
Sentence: but , my dearest jane , you can not seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ''
Perplexity : 1788.5699534186917
Sentence: `` if we thought alike of miss bingley , '' replied jane , `` your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .

Sentence: you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . ''

Perplexity : 1149.9665203735556

Perplexity : 2296.0752532602305

Perplexity : 2131.8565137484493
Sentence: the possibility of mr. collins 's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , '' engaged to mr. collins !

Sentence: my dear charlotte , impossible ! ''
Perplexity : 2456.3184516721035

Perplexity : 2002.1559577917988

Sentence: with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , '' good lord !

Sentence: sir william , how can you tell such a story ?
Perplexity : 2037.4370210226496

Sentence: elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr. collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .
Perplexity : 2202.260315785996

Sentence: mr. bennet 's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !
Perplexity : 2032.2966365829232
Sentence: jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .
Perplexity : 2484.230067958009

Sentence: lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs. bennet 's sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .

Sentence: poor jane !

Sentence: it had better have happened to you , lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .
Perplexity : 2312.928152320726
Sentence: but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?
Perplexity : 1734.978295659006
Sentence: change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . ''
Perplexity : 2623.3113488837985

Perplexity : 2311.6389472414107

Perplexity : 1560.5090431145757

Perplexity : 2076.22708537652
Sentence: `` and that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr. darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london !
Perplexity : 1916.2747262052244
Sentence: mr. darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month 's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , mr. bingley never stirs without him . ''
Perplexity : 2157.289802898654
Sentence: `` so much the better .

Perplexity : 2941.7829751502363
Sentence: but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley 's being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .
Perplexity : 1863.79826860776
Sentence: it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane 's attractions .
Perplexity : 2259.9135643919926
Sentence: miss bennet accepted her aunt 's invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline 's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .
Perplexity : 2221.7384091703907
Sentence: the gardiners staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .
Perplexity : 1701.4598139709617
Sentence: mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .
Perplexity : 1950.3494445740607
Sentence: when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , mrs. gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth 's warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .
Perplexity : 2040.4286730729239
Sentence: without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .
Perplexity : 2023.1984748657892
Sentence: to mrs. gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .
Perplexity : 2501.6224992264597
Sentence: about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged .
Perplexity : 2312.065414579049
Sentence: they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy 's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring .
Perplexity : 1926.5441991433463

Perplexity : 2256.4996895294476
Sentence: on being made acquainted with the present mr. darcy 's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman 's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy .
Perplexity : 2148.6004377398294
Sentence: mrs. gardiner 's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : '' you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly .
Perplexity : 1917.6450492510928
Sentence: seriously , i would have you be on your guard .
Perplexity : 2426.73156575498
Sentence: do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .
Perplexity : 2674.324083491611
Sentence: i have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better .
Perplexity : 1731.898315929801
Sentence: you have sense , and we all expect you to use it .
Perplexity : 2488.191262948097

Sentence: `` yes , and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise . ''
Perplexity : 1578.8184187194054
Sentence: `` well , then , you need not be under any alarm .
Perplexity : 1645.5036453933726
Sentence: he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it . ''
Perplexity : 1271.6059120175473
Sentence: `` i beg your pardon .
Perplexity : 1492.8231127633449
Sentence: i will try again .
Perplexity : 2574.713485466156
Sentence: at present i am not in love with mr. wickham ; no , i certainly am not .
Perplexity : 1790.5532800739768
Sentence: my father 's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and i should be miserable to forfeit it .
Perplexity : 2004.1439946807975
Sentence: my father , however , is partial to mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 1346.4451011212536
Sentence: in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?
Perplexity : 2172.6247251190152
Sentence: all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .
Perplexity : 1230.3186458626342
Sentence: i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .
Perplexity : 1517.8991186750693
Sentence: when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing .
Perplexity : 1135.7825808895961
Sentence: in short , i will do my best . ''
Perplexity : 1935.4194976571835
Sentence: `` perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .
Perplexity : 1991.2086983437018
Sentence: at least , you should not remind your mother of inviting him . ''
Perplexity : 2115.412007327444
Sentence: `` as i did the other day , '' said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; `` very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that .
Perplexity : 1401.089937346722
Sentence: but do not imagine that he is always here so often .
Perplexity : 2097.306919552987
Sentence: you know my mother 's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .
Perplexity : 2080.9945625284413
Sentence: but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest ; and now , i hope you are satisfied . ''
Perplexity : 1919.3987572083786
Sentence: her aunt assured her that she was ; and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .
Perplexity : 2104.698218096441

Sentence: as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte 's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .
Perplexity : 1655.0207108923632
Sentence: but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr. collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship 's praise into his own hands .
Perplexity : 1974.292681782818
Sentence: sir william staid only a week at hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter 's being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .
Perplexity : 2387.13524116664
Sentence: while sir william was with them , mr. collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .

Sentence: the room in which the ladies sat was backwards .
Perplexity : 2663.0138781045225
Sentence: elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement .
Perplexity : 2225.339948857712
Sentence: from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .
Perplexity : 2207.0186731589
Sentence: she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .
Perplexity : 1842.034408245007
Sentence: very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .
Perplexity : 2177.6546419689976
Sentence: now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .
Perplexity : 1953.1705929486113
Sentence: she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collins 's joints of meat were too large for her family .
Perplexity : 2365.1147603473337
Sentence: elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr. collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .
Perplexity : 2544.668674760816
Sentence: the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .
Perplexity : 2072.7389634192773
Sentence: their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses ' reach .
Perplexity : 2645.0771975531625
Sentence: this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .
Perplexity : 2060.7051791240724
Sentence: her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine 's curiosity .
Perplexity : 2045.4067917563943
Sentence: in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .
Perplexity : 2632.9173560838162
Sentence: easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .
Perplexity : 2105.2778247441315
Sentence: elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr. darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley 's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself .
Perplexity : 2081.77109387626
Sentence: his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr. collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence .
Perplexity : 2065.0872870664175
Sentence: on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects .
Perplexity : 2542.169272340606
Sentence: there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr. darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when mr. collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him .
Perplexity : 2081.2662837693347
Sentence: charlotte had seen them from her husband 's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , '' i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility .
Perplexity : 2311.031701560387
Sentence: mr. darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . ''
Perplexity : 2046.3805683814028
Sentence: elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .
Perplexity : 2397.117159036736
Sentence: colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman .
Perplexity : 2475.550895992511
Sentence: mr. darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs. collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .

Perplexity : 1298.3336137442268

Perplexity : 2158.911027323984
Sentence: `` my fingers , '' said elizabeth , `` do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women 's do .
Perplexity : 1768.6468810401284
Sentence: they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .
Perplexity : 2582.6193522734884
Sentence: but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising .
Perplexity : 2024.3258960768826

Perplexity : 1456.9847500785268

Sentence: here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .
Perplexity : 1925.8339739795706
Sentence: elizabeth immediately began playing again .
Perplexity : 2939.249989368036
Sentence: lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy , '' miss bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master .
Perplexity : 1827.7648577716266
Sentence: she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne 's .
Perplexity : 2556.0439296320515
Sentence: anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . ''
Perplexity : 2131.001437301706
Sentence: elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin 's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .
Perplexity : 1934.7281246472878
Sentence: lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth 's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .
Perplexity : 2877.6968931995216
Sentence: elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship 's carriage was ready to take them all home .

Sentence: elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .
Perplexity : 2072.7398534867903
Sentence: as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr. darcy , and mr. darcy only , entered the room .
Perplexity : 1753.0379338885018
Sentence: he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .
Perplexity : 2620.1804145465894
Sentence: they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .
Perplexity : 2424.2038285733597
Sentence: it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , '' how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 1901.2683594951557
Sentence: it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before .
Perplexity : 1975.6703124175913
Sentence: he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london . ''
Perplexity : 1589.3654347036259
Sentence: `` perfectly so i thank you . ''
Perplexity : 1561.3011292210235
Sentence: she found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , '' i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ? ''
Perplexity : 1705.1281740311226
Sentence: `` i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .
Perplexity : 1845.796872225636
Sentence: `` if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .
Perplexity : 2175.653218000534
Sentence: but perhaps mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . ''
Perplexity : 2363.2554565118826
Sentence: `` i should not be surprised , '' said darcy , `` if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . ''
Perplexity : 1187.4808140994323
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer .
Perplexity : 643.1732957101668
Sentence: she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .
Perplexity : 1800.5389890673957
Sentence: he took the hint , and soon began with , `` this seems a very comfortable house .
Perplexity : 2298.3121287166523
Sentence: lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr. collins first came to hunsford . ''
Perplexity : 1712.7667920705524
Sentence: `` i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . ''
Perplexity : 1660.7875056544078
Sentence: `` yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .
Perplexity : 2200.5711135100055
Sentence: my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did .
Perplexity : 2434.6545402840406
Sentence: she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . ''
Perplexity : 1474.0606895208525
Sentence: `` it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . ''
Perplexity : 1934.314283804857
Sentence: `` an easy distance do you call it ?
Perplexity : 2620.4270952500556
Sentence: it is nearly fifty miles . ''
Perplexity : 2954.7333334635355
Sentence: yes , i call it a very easy distance . ''
Perplexity : 2620.519460307213
Sentence: `` i should never have said mrs. collins was settled near her family . ''
Perplexity : 1963.595773339415
Sentence: `` it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire .
Perplexity : 1557.5638311893986
Sentence: any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far . ''
Perplexity : 2130.3564217688936
Sentence: as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , '' i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .
Perplexity : 1868.645546319226
Sentence: the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .
Perplexity : 2823.6045354942403
Sentence: where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .
Perplexity : 2714.330236442906
Sentence: mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , `` you can not have a right to such very strong local attachment .
Perplexity : 1705.551349003424
Sentence: you can not have been always at longbourn . ''
Perplexity : 1493.822006624976
Sentence: elizabeth looked surprised .
Perplexity : 2940.4998299608874
Sentence: the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , '' are you pleased with kent ? ''
Perplexity : 2351.943113587024
Sentence: a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .
Perplexity : 1900.3940705223213
Sentence: the tte  tte surprised them .
Perplexity : 2256.8190926353523
Sentence: mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .
Perplexity : 1979.5641227710607
Sentence: `` what can be the meaning of this ! ''
Perplexity : 1984.7586539011938
Sentence: said charlotte , as soon as he was gone .
Perplexity : 838.2188984497002
Sentence: but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte 's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .
Perplexity : 2182.7702683781063
Sentence: all field sports were over .
Perplexity : 2939.2499681077256
Sentence: within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen can not be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .
Perplexity : 2052.597298829556
Sentence: they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .
Perplexity : 2446.0864559344072
Sentence: it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam 's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .
Perplexity : 2085.698730976865
Sentence: but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .
Perplexity : 2248.2571659391474
Sentence: mrs. collins knew not what to make of him .
Perplexity : 1772.9778669857924
Sentence: colonel fitzwilliam 's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .
Perplexity : 1986.8970842672034
Sentence: she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success .
Perplexity : 2271.8045719689535
Sentence: he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .
Perplexity : 1920.3031668966903
Sentence: it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .
Perplexity : 2153.1842917260356
Sentence: she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend 's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .
Perplexity : 1996.8945010246962
Sentence: he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .
Perplexity : 1909.1433992319928
Sentence: more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 2206.0564317090298
Sentence: she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .
Perplexity : 2223.468585142716
Sentence: yet it did , and even a third .
Perplexity : 2308.5368607672194
Sentence: it seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .
Perplexity : 2409.8031322743027
Sentence: he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collins 's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too .
Perplexity : 2106.2887253595463
Sentence: his words seemed to imply it .
Perplexity : 2940.7980877182194
Sentence: she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .
Perplexity : 2313.8814202192334
Sentence: it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage .
Perplexity : 1845.7808824644771
Sentence: she was engaged one day as she walked , in re perusing jane 's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .
Perplexity : 2293.8392958840927
Sentence: putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , '' i did not know before that you ever walked this way . ''
Perplexity : 1657.918172644224

Sentence: `` yes if darcy does not put it off again .

Sentence: he arranges the business just as he pleases . ''
Perplexity : 2318.9004677233047

Perplexity : 2244.453027693368
Sentence: i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr .
Perplexity : 1959.1847177837296
Sentence: darcy . ''
Perplexity : 842.7142857142858
Sentence: `` he likes to have his own way very well , '' replied colonel fitzwilliam .
Perplexity : 1897.21923542208
Sentence: `` but so we all do .

Sentence: i speak feelingly .
Perplexity : 2939.499957475762
Sentence: a younger son , you know , must be inured to self denial and dependence . ''
Perplexity : 1995.3229253143863
Sentence: `` in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .
Perplexity : 2152.9620035722455
Sentence: now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ?
Perplexity : 2596.9976545854347
Sentence: when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? ''
Perplexity : 2846.467500403728
Sentence: `` these are home questions and perhaps i can not say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature .
Perplexity : 2107.0130913751796
Sentence: but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money .
Perplexity : 2338.8152839587647
Sentence: younger sons can not marry where they like . ''
Perplexity : 2799.896064222822
Sentence: `` our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . ''
Perplexity : 2716.1289821523487
Sentence: `` is this , '' thought elizabeth , `` meant for me ? ''
Perplexity : 1591.3208178243378
Sentence: and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , `` and pray , what is the usual price of an earl 's younger son ?
Perplexity : 2167.7398762606813
Sentence: unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . ''
Perplexity : 2292.9483557523918
Sentence: he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .
Perplexity : 1716.275121888369
Sentence: to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , '' i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .
Perplexity : 2105.3087572424884
Sentence: i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .
Perplexity : 2449.391396785243
Sentence: but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . ''
Perplexity : 1899.9136213013094
Sentence: `` no , '' said colonel fitzwilliam , `` that is an advantage which he must divide with me .
Perplexity : 1137.3912558410557
Sentence: i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy . ''
Perplexity : 1771.3993363823329
Sentence: `` are you , indeed ?
Perplexity : 2484.7070995778217
Sentence: and pray what sort of guardians do you make ?
Perplexity : 2438.7913837710726
Sentence: does your charge give you much trouble ?
Perplexity : 2940.166133203299
Sentence: young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . ''
Perplexity : 2307.0640955111235
Sentence: as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .
Perplexity : 2053.270069921698
Sentence: she directly replied , '' you need not be frightened .
Perplexity : 1838.903495534642
Sentence: i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .
Perplexity : 1106.834970565556
Sentence: she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs. hurst and miss bingley .
Perplexity : 1538.9372332831795
Sentence: i think i have heard you say that you know them . ''
Perplexity : 1532.203365560994
Sentence: `` i know them a little .
Perplexity : 2152.825821498185
Sentence: their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy 's . ''
Perplexity : 2045.5253416916996
Sentence: yes , '' said elizabeth drily `` mr. darcy is uncommonly kind to mr. bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . ''
Perplexity : 1291.4761333373776
Sentence: yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .
Perplexity : 2512.7035698433656
Sentence: from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .
Perplexity : 2252.046502295656
Sentence: but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant .
Perplexity : 1884.0525799161226
Sentence: it was all conjecture . ''
Perplexity : 2253.5271453826313
Sentence: `` what is it you mean ? ''
Perplexity : 1609.7958787709
Sentence: `` it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady 's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . ''
Perplexity : 1946.600478896948
Sentence: `` you may depend upon my not mentioning it . ''
Perplexity : 1335.0966606173106
Sentence: `` and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley .
Perplexity : 1818.1454322306956
Sentence: what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . ''
Perplexity : 2342.926978460834
Sentence: `` and what arts did he use to separate them ? ''
Perplexity : 2494.593779525613
Sentence: `` he did not talk to me of his own arts , '' said fitzwilliam smiling .
Perplexity : 1646.1593470813823
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .
Perplexity : 1762.766780920271
Sentence: after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .
Perplexity : 2491.1210393192764
Sentence: `` i am thinking of what you have been telling me , '' said she .
Perplexity : 903.3523662022312
Sentence: `` your cousin 's conduct does not suit my feelings .
Perplexity : 2813.7196396332847
Sentence: `` you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? ''
Perplexity : 2394.1243702948536
Sentence: `` i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend 's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . ''
Perplexity : 1924.248443848362
Sentence: `` but , '' she continued , recollecting herself , `` as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .
Perplexity : 1666.7086928477663
Sentence: it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . ''
Perplexity : 1356.8914773615202
Sentence: there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .
Perplexity : 1451.8496810544348
Sentence: it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .
Perplexity : 1959.5139964454759
Sentence: there could not exist in the world two men , over whom mr. darcy could have such boundless influence .
Perplexity : 2425.764721885094
Sentence: he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .
Perplexity : 2293.3439141046892
Sentence: `` there were some very strong objections against the lady , '' were colonel fitzwilliam 's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london .
Perplexity : 2719.2741427201317
Sentence: `` to jane herself , '' she exclaimed , `` there could be no possibility of objection .
Perplexity : 2114.555105575167
Sentence: her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .
Perplexity : 2242.8783092026033
Sentence: neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . ''
Perplexity : 2454.7281077678676
Sentence: the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .
Perplexity : 2476.316258867337
Sentence: mrs. collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr. collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine 's being rather displeased by her staying at home .
Perplexity : 1949.7266245685541
Sentence: when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent .
Perplexity : 1987.0314769609943
Sentence: they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .
Perplexity : 2593.5877684390334
Sentence: but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .
Perplexity : 2151.664858866224
Sentence: elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .
Perplexity : 2433.199661193997
Sentence: mr. darcy 's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister 's sufferings .
Perplexity : 1762.8383583405273
Sentence: it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .
Perplexity : 2287.9190988429427
Sentence: she could not think of darcy 's leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .
Perplexity : 1853.4705770104174
Sentence: while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .
Perplexity : 1968.2174236629528
Sentence: but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr. darcy walk into the room .
Perplexity : 1893.7232827924036
Sentence: in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .
Perplexity : 2661.281925198603
Sentence: she answered him with cold civility .
Perplexity : 2501.106420240389
Sentence: he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .
Perplexity : 1442.4625823690126
Sentence: elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .
Perplexity : 1602.2450259165819
Sentence: after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , '' in vain have i struggled .
Perplexity : 2731.505732503016
Sentence: my feelings will not be repressed .
Perplexity : 1904.4621997364568
Sentence: you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you . ''
Perplexity : 1896.9914229041083
Sentence: this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .
Perplexity : 1950.2500173306955
Sentence: he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .
Perplexity : 1977.148097262405
Sentence: his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .
Perplexity : 2585.039267547032
Sentence: in spite of her deeply rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man 's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .
Perplexity : 1927.2379783773608
Sentence: she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .
Perplexity : 1819.1894048838774
Sentence: he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .
Perplexity : 1991.2183102358154
Sentence: as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .
Perplexity : 1783.29463497313
Sentence: he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .
Perplexity : 2479.387863142578
Sentence: such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , '' in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .
Perplexity : 2012.735663988677
Sentence: it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you .
Perplexity : 2188.0486999955006
Sentence: but i can not i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .
Perplexity : 1844.7367881663038
Sentence: i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .
Perplexity : 1808.1698777414692
Sentence: it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration .
Perplexity : 1449.568630229583
Sentence: the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . ''
Perplexity : 2762.241573767224
Sentence: mr. darcy , who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .
Perplexity : 2056.5170067594177
Sentence: his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .
Perplexity : 2276.7598806015003
Sentence: he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .
Perplexity : 2270.7414859481246
Sentence: the pause was to elizabeth 's feelings dreadful .
Perplexity : 2519.305497776129
Sentence: at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , '' and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !
Perplexity : 1680.0409473437203
Sentence: i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected .
Perplexity : 2264.1005152542575
Sentence: but it is of small importance . ''
Perplexity : 1791.0430457897537
Sentence: `` i might as well enquire , '' replied she , `` why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?
Perplexity : 2379.40650580895
Sentence: was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil ?
Perplexity : 2275.5438729346915
Sentence: you know i have .
Perplexity : 2595.827387634874
Sentence: as she pronounced these words , mr. darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .
Perplexity : 2333.1230433849228
Sentence: `` i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .
Perplexity : 1543.4248342495275
Sentence: no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .
Perplexity : 2939.045451030842
Sentence: you dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . ''
Perplexity : 2255.5873511277446
Sentence: she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .
Perplexity : 2415.331469255063
Sentence: he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .
Perplexity : 1850.3684078559425
Sentence: with assumed tranquillity he then replied , `` i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success .
Perplexity : 1772.944660133387
Sentence: towards him i have been kinder than towards myself . ''
Perplexity : 1984.4503690409601
Sentence: elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .
Perplexity : 2549.695273886529
Sentence: long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .
Perplexity : 2429.180450885081
Sentence: your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 2744.5229121375555
Sentence: on this subject , what can you have to say ?
Perplexity : 1970.076611179893
Sentence: in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?
Perplexity : 2823.8005070274744
Sentence: or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? ''
Perplexity : 2731.4356393114426
Sentence: `` you take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns , '' said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .
Perplexity : 1943.2405664069013
Sentence: `` who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? ''
Perplexity : 2607.1461636056074
Sentence: `` his misfortunes ! ''
Perplexity : 2940.666317181231
Sentence: repeated darcy contemptuously ; `` yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . ''
Perplexity : 2186.944641586831
Sentence: `` and of your infliction , '' cried elizabeth with energy .
Perplexity : 1807.2021207808496
Sentence: you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .
Perplexity : 1978.523280022644
Sentence: you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .
Perplexity : 2769.881134802074
Sentence: you have done all this !
Perplexity : 2409.7663060111367
Sentence: and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . ''
Perplexity : 2781.6205070875662
Sentence: `` and this , '' cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , '' is your opinion of me !
Perplexity : 1571.896916274421
Sentence: this is the estimation in which you hold me !
Perplexity : 2625.7274991944323
Sentence: i thank you for explaining it so fully .
Perplexity : 2513.7013683372174
Sentence: my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !
Perplexity : 2594.3969260348567
Sentence: but perhaps , '' added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , `` these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .
Perplexity : 2436.896432028058
Sentence: but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .
Perplexity : 2941.210603660929
Sentence: nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .
Perplexity : 2817.82404144849
Sentence: to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? ''
Perplexity : 2580.0043231394216
Sentence: elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , '' you are mistaken , mr. darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ''
Perplexity : 2088.525082715934
Sentence: she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , '' you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ''
Perplexity : 1770.0087128647317
Sentence: again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .
Perplexity : 1952.8697079127
Sentence: she went on .
Perplexity : 2402.336987185603
Sentence: `` from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry . ''
Perplexity : 2223.3627654775496
Sentence: `` you have said quite enough , madam .
Perplexity : 2328.203176550741
Sentence: i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .
Perplexity : 2530.565058866074
Sentence: forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . ''
Perplexity : 2512.3064003988206
Sentence: and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .
Perplexity : 2024.2391700306807
Sentence: the tumult of her mind was now painfully great .
Perplexity : 2246.0959205586983
Sentence: she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .
Perplexity : 1870.2195468425696
Sentence: her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .
Perplexity : 1708.8974113094878
Sentence: that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 1597.6382598407092
Sentence: that he should have been in love with her for so many months !
Perplexity : 1369.1011060085902
Sentence: so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend 's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !
Perplexity : 1943.3017686599044
Sentence: it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .
Perplexity : 2614.686724628031
Sentence: but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr. wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .

Sentence: she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr. darcy 's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .
Perplexity : 2039.6023958062522
Sentence: the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .
Perplexity : 1898.5161554503354

Perplexity : 2343.3655097662254
Sentence: i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .
Perplexity : 1952.7587151685714
Sentence: you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice .

Sentence: `` two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .
Perplexity : 2266.8364457593275
Sentence: wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .
Perplexity : 2312.317669723128
Sentence: but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .

Sentence: your sister i also watched .
Perplexity : 2658.393394487442
Sentence: her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening 's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .
Perplexity : 2296.313377449776
Sentence: your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .
Perplexity : 2580.404547360937
Sentence: if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .
Perplexity : 2031.1531430824577
Sentence: but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister 's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .
Perplexity : 2215.8463519854567
Sentence: that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .
Perplexity : 2461.9278219766084
Sentence: i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ; i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason .
Perplexity : 2323.0704272691573
Sentence: my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .
Perplexity : 2373.705678917872
Sentence: but there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .

Sentence: these causes must be stated , though briefly .
Perplexity : 2951.4300492545035

Sentence: pardon me .
Perplexity : 2940.0
Sentence: it pains me to offend you .
Perplexity : 2942.4922691769602
Sentence: but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .
Perplexity : 2568.833573214966
Sentence: i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .
Perplexity : 2580.0847374423993

Perplexity : 1841.6130084481995
Sentence: the part which i acted , is now to be explained .
Perplexity : 2730.279787432161

Sentence: we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .
Perplexity : 2604.9359502562356
Sentence: but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister 's indifference .
Perplexity : 2291.346624726723
Sentence: he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .
Perplexity : 2683.9032210023365
Sentence: but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .
Perplexity : 2388.4783978295964
Sentence: to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .
Perplexity : 1662.5993341381409
Sentence: to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .
Perplexity : 2352.186847989812
Sentence: i can not blame myself for having done thus much .
Perplexity : 2087.311228335328
Sentence: there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town .
Perplexity : 2131.383193681914
Sentence: i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .
Perplexity : 1872.5355731685634
Sentence: that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .
Perplexity : 2304.015942723038
Sentence: perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .
Perplexity : 2946.162440634653
Sentence: it is done , however , and it was done for the best .
Perplexity : 1402.7579537581394
Sentence: on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .
Perplexity : 1698.453937015485
Sentence: if i have wounded your sister 's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them .
Perplexity : 1981.26743482737
Sentence: with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr. wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .
Perplexity : 2249.548212172368
Sentence: of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .
Perplexity : 2317.6777483119695
Sentence: mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .
Perplexity : 2024.6468826742987
Sentence: my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education .
Perplexity : 2221.989044598982
Sentence: my father was not only fond of this young man 's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .
Perplexity : 2225.9002013331033
Sentence: the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr. darcy could not have .
Perplexity : 2099.242390396781
Sentence: but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .
Perplexity : 2587.56068258907
Sentence: it adds even another motive .
Perplexity : 2939.1249920261416
Sentence: my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .
Perplexity : 2257.9530103200095
Sentence: his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr. wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .
Perplexity : 2524.8765027113877
Sentence: i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman .
Perplexity : 1483.1533447347585
Sentence: the business was therefore soon settled .
Perplexity : 2940.5991606377065

Perplexity : 2939.16665721612
Sentence: i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town .
Perplexity : 2096.810149856401
Sentence: for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .
Perplexity : 2181.809422914778
Sentence: his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .
Perplexity : 1882.4720807962783
Sentence: he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions .
Perplexity : 2042.4269959742026
Sentence: you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .
Perplexity : 2419.3726108188907
Sentence: his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .
Perplexity : 2593.831837772204
Sentence: after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .
Perplexity : 2811.5482180297254
Sentence: how he lived i know not .
Perplexity : 2363.104831523335
Sentence: but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
Perplexity : 2839.6724466420324
Sentence: having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy .
Perplexity : 2254.230004312954
Sentence: my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .
Perplexity : 2082.715680445347
Sentence: about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .
Perplexity : 2337.1949460892897
Sentence: she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .
Perplexity : 1952.8994402560008
Sentence: i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .
Perplexity : 2396.0714413062906
Sentence: you may imagine what i felt and how i acted .
Perplexity : 2690.6332371044555
Sentence: regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge .
Perplexity : 2112.469410500376
Sentence: mr. wickham 's chief object was unquestionably my sister 's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .
Perplexity : 1886.838414797695
Sentence: this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 1917.0705516509452
Sentence: ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .
Perplexity : 2400.8690555536045
Sentence: you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .
Perplexity : 2453.616491744809
Sentence: but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .
Perplexity : 2091.897727787596
Sentence: for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .
Perplexity : 2282.828742020505
Sentence: if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .
Perplexity : 1960.7866280921164
Sentence: i will only add , god bless you .
Perplexity : 2777.160324563027
Sentence: `` fitzwilliam darcy . ''
Perplexity : 1938.1369838805224
Sentence: if elizabeth , when mr. darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .
Perplexity : 2042.854821255536
Sentence: but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .
Perplexity : 2184.88309968373
Sentence: her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .
Perplexity : 2709.6879463486503
Sentence: with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .
Perplexity : 2523.791622258921
Sentence: she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .
Perplexity : 2420.6618381311764
Sentence: his belief of her sister 's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .
Perplexity : 2296.6695190262085
Sentence: he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .
Perplexity : 2483.8065930999637
Sentence: it was all pride and insolence .
Perplexity : 2376.619718701338
Sentence: but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .
Perplexity : 2417.6910625822607
Sentence: astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .
Perplexity : 2547.409080107201
Sentence: she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , `` this must be false !
Perplexity : 2381.6103950909296
Sentence: this must be the grossest falsehood ! ''
Perplexity : 2339.476592285415
Sentence: in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .
Perplexity : 2167.4268629330627
Sentence: the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .
Perplexity : 1853.5013966704457
Sentence: so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .
Perplexity : 2497.4378027354296
Sentence: what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .
Perplexity : 1907.443993877113
Sentence: but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham 's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .
Perplexity : 2539.281848260822
Sentence: she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success .
Perplexity : 2504.826655126101
Sentence: on both sides it was only assertion .
Perplexity : 2261.492296697445
Sentence: again she read on .
Perplexity : 2334.0084477026826
Sentence: but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr. darcy 's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .
Perplexity : 2300.412922051155
Sentence: the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr. wickham 's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .
Perplexity : 2357.9405665097743
Sentence: she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .
Perplexity : 2010.944337104738
Sentence: of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself .
Perplexity : 2815.0846995366883
Sentence: as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .
Perplexity : 1769.8244562868679
Sentence: his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .
Perplexity : 2792.4085620508035
Sentence: she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .
Perplexity : 2406.2225669346644
Sentence: but no such recollection befriended her .
Perplexity : 2711.549922542228
Sentence: she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .
Perplexity : 2102.4258718020624
Sentence: after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .
Perplexity : 2807.316733105747
Sentence: but , alas !
Perplexity : 1965.491343715922
Sentence: the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin 's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .
Perplexity : 2363.140602675531

Perplexity : 2170.620256527862
Sentence: elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .
Perplexity : 2008.4499742104765
Sentence: elizabeth 's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr. darcy and herself .
Perplexity : 2088.8409406933897
Sentence: miss bennet 's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .

Sentence: what a stroke was this for poor jane !
Perplexity : 2775.0133819994885

Perplexity : 2627.298886209183
Sentence: most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .
Perplexity : 2426.724464812687
Sentence: `` this will not do , '' said elizabeth .
Perplexity : 840.4748388299076

Perplexity : 722.0580447560693

Sentence: and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !

Sentence: and having to relate such a thing of his sister !
Perplexity : 2291.1180319527793
Sentence: it is really too distressing .
Perplexity : 2416.2655121253392
Sentence: i am sure you must feel it so . ''
Perplexity : 1424.0024943467854
Sentence: no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .
Perplexity : 2679.591619705869
Sentence: i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .

Sentence: `` i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . ''
Perplexity : 1995.574816745619
Sentence: `` and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .
Perplexity : 2276.4862552183163
Sentence: it is such a spur to one 's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .
Perplexity : 2360.816996602054
Sentence: one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . ''
Perplexity : 2485.053687217873
Sentence: `` lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . ''
Perplexity : 1520.9031235375717
Sentence: and with no one to speak to , of what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had !
Perplexity : 2173.319552532869
Sentence: how i wanted you ! ''
Perplexity : 2656.9284460645827
Sentence: `` how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved . ''
Perplexity : 2163.5853131886
Sentence: but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging .
Perplexity : 2527.7769373930983
Sentence: there is one point , on which i want your advice .
Perplexity : 2237.5594569586247

Perplexity : 2221.153796942609
Sentence: mr. darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .
Perplexity : 2363.134224652836
Sentence: on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?
Perplexity : 1833.8972820558267
Sentence: the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .
Perplexity : 1938.959209566418
Sentence: i am not equal to it .
Perplexity : 1252.2393578110948
Sentence: wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .
Perplexity : 2355.825038762261
Sentence: at present i will say nothing about it . ''
Perplexity : 1318.239146768088
Sentence: `` you are quite right .

Sentence: he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character .
Perplexity : 2318.4056995314795

Perplexity : 2183.5940373592753

Perplexity : 2501.3606672904666
Sentence: she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .
Perplexity : 2468.923750853639
Sentence: here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .
Perplexity : 2286.9135355314243
Sentence: `` and then , '' said she , `` if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .

Sentence: she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .
Perplexity : 2798.669362797975
Sentence: having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .
Perplexity : 2489.2291862746547
Sentence: `` well , lizzy , '' said mrs. bennet one day , `` what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane 's ?
Perplexity : 1255.051571342984

Sentence: this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .

Sentence: in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned .
Perplexity : 1980.3744825782471
Sentence: as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .
Perplexity : 2239.5432990317563
Sentence: she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia 's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .
Perplexity : 2183.26107476372
Sentence: `` if you were aware , '' said elizabeth , `` of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia 's unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair . ''

Perplexity : 1885.4663020407888

Perplexity : 1738.9072808059648

Perplexity : 2342.3416771514126
Sentence: a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .

Perplexity : 2010.1081148639757

Sentence: we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton .

Sentence: let her go then .
Perplexity : 2333.3472104730245

Perplexity : 2946.9466593264438
Sentence: had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?
Perplexity : 2539.706697066456
Sentence: they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .
Perplexity : 2080.5685945312334
Sentence: lydia 's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband 's never intending to go there himself .

Sentence: elizabeth was now to see mr. wickham for the last time .
Perplexity : 2229.5232435156436

Perplexity : 2609.6565907208415
Sentence: in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .
Perplexity : 2327.711921407775
Sentence: she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .
Perplexity : 2554.897256542639
Sentence: on the very last day of the regiment 's remaining in meryton , he dined with others of the officers at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam 's and mr. darcy 's having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .
Perplexity : 2043.1314699049908
Sentence: he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment 's recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man , asked her how she had liked him .

Sentence: cried wickham with a look which did not escape her .
Perplexity : 2547.245915530914
Sentence: but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , `` is it in address that he improves ?
Perplexity : 2411.1158409145814
Sentence: has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?
Perplexity : 2836.215763625022
Sentence: for i dare not hope , '' he continued in a lower and more serious tone , `` that he is improved in essentials . ''
Perplexity : 1790.0828730098817
Sentence: `` oh , no ! ''
Perplexity : 1882.005258200846
Sentence: said elizabeth .
Perplexity : 657.111111111111
Sentence: there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , '' when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . ''
Perplexity : 2240.001719886626
Sentence: wickham 's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , '' you , who so well know my feelings towards mr. darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .
Perplexity : 2264.2095337997125
Sentence: his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by .
Perplexity : 2381.2746638317385
Sentence: elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .
Perplexity : 2155.8893191273337
Sentence: she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .
Perplexity : 2027.7510791276486
Sentence: the rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .
Perplexity : 2188.911534940138
Sentence: when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .
Perplexity : 2327.335869141729

Sentence: kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy .
Perplexity : 2318.5617579469867
Sentence: mrs. bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .
Perplexity : 2131.96774109202
Sentence: had elizabeth 's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .
Perplexity : 2091.65596485245
Sentence: her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .
Perplexity : 2295.178366900443
Sentence: respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .
Perplexity : 2806.535145198124
Sentence: he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .
Perplexity : 2588.2218891255343
Sentence: elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father 's behaviour as a husband .
Perplexity : 1726.2003393960501
Sentence: she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .
Perplexity : 2386.803598258904
Sentence: but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .
Perplexity : 2612.854423547745
Sentence: when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham 's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .
Perplexity : 2368.8750162891088
Sentence: their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .
Perplexity : 2539.3541556480372
Sentence: upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .
Perplexity : 2081.894494852439
Sentence: it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .
Perplexity : 2511.5435779446866
Sentence: `` but it is fortunate , '' thought she , `` that i have something to wish for .
Perplexity : 1134.6406732144019
Sentence: were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .
Perplexity : 2832.7414479398826
Sentence: but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister 's absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized .
Perplexity : 2644.66742152131
Sentence: a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . ''
Perplexity : 2780.9238053818376
Sentence: those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs. forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .
Perplexity : 2068.3742816665267

Perplexity : 2176.842651477975
Sentence: mrs. bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton .
Perplexity : 2401.1875451372152
Sentence: mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire .
Perplexity : 2304.2071876167397
Sentence: the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak .
Perplexity : 2401.555246306358
Sentence: elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough .
Perplexity : 2601.677197006098
Sentence: but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again .

Sentence: but they did pass away , and mr. and mrs. gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn .
Perplexity : 1740.025262382154
Sentence: the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .
Perplexity : 2448.9553523643704
Sentence: the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .
Perplexity : 2281.053034944439
Sentence: it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenelworth , birmingham , & c. are sufficiently known .
Perplexity : 2359.9345937494295

Perplexity : 2502.582277193105
Sentence: said her aunt .
Perplexity : 1701.1625436741772
Sentence: wickham passed all his youth there , you know . ''
Perplexity : 1946.2697603746358
Sentence: elizabeth was distressed .
Perplexity : 2411.4955594678872

Perplexity : 2645.425858322828
Sentence: mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity .
Perplexity : 2944.857465712479

Perplexity : 1878.0661128118368
Sentence: she blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .
Perplexity : 2292.865489001207
Sentence: but against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .
Perplexity : 2013.7409329042973
Sentence: accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer .
Perplexity : 2298.2047500153053
Sentence: a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .

Sentence: she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .
Perplexity : 2628.5089016045786

Perplexity : 2032.1952928201142

Perplexity : 2236.9091635238765
Sentence: in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy 's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .
Perplexity : 2364.540151207948
Sentence: in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .
Perplexity : 2619.127412899941
Sentence: at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr. darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .
Perplexity : 1823.0376050749062
Sentence: she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .
Perplexity : 2854.505056443744
Sentence: mrs. reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father 's life time .
Perplexity : 1859.4823875713018
Sentence: the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds was of no trifling nature .
Perplexity : 2940.582923678999
Sentence: what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?
Perplexity : 2941.0893744262617
Sentence: as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people 's happiness were in his guardianship !
Perplexity : 2666.832809481627
Sentence: how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow !
Perplexity : 2290.9460380135174
Sentence: how much of good or evil must be done by him !
Perplexity : 2534.124794586312
Sentence: every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .
Perplexity : 2387.229518599451
Sentence: when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .
Perplexity : 2578.604019893439
Sentence: as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .
Perplexity : 2409.0943476129837
Sentence: they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .
Perplexity : 1669.2495073088278
Sentence: their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .
Perplexity : 2197.577746077698
Sentence: he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .
Perplexity : 2367.4881300343204
Sentence: had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr. darcy , the gardener 's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .
Perplexity : 2561.9707470920957
Sentence: they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .
Perplexity : 2328.5290159198953
Sentence: amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .
Perplexity : 2416.8393405051224
Sentence: nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .
Perplexity : 2276.333187871238
Sentence: at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .
Perplexity : 1898.729263445282
Sentence: she was overpowered by shame and vexation .
Perplexity : 2631.193776665495
Sentence: her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world !
Perplexity : 2288.166997991603
Sentence: how strange must it appear to him !
Perplexity : 2944.2356042174133
Sentence: in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !
Perplexity : 2569.997755267494
Sentence: it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !
Perplexity : 2414.998501955128
Sentence: why did she come ?
Perplexity : 2942.4983859950294
Sentence: or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?
Perplexity : 2663.2008653805674
Sentence: she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .
Perplexity : 2157.1844677864733
Sentence: and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ?
Perplexity : 2945.0806203498555
Sentence: that he should even speak to her was amazing !
Perplexity : 2079.295748650322
Sentence: but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !
Perplexity : 2482.417035703798
Sentence: what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing 's park , when he put his letter into her hand !
Perplexity : 2655.2368253546247
Sentence: she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .
Perplexity : 1830.7411722805266
Sentence: they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .
Perplexity : 1991.4357490357752
Sentence: she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .
Perplexity : 1739.2056538954084
Sentence: perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .
Perplexity : 2380.3565392380265
Sentence: whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .
Perplexity : 1977.2438899578096
Sentence: at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .
Perplexity : 1673.8194723437566
Sentence: they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .
Perplexity : 2550.7038348899655
Sentence: mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .
Perplexity : 2652.2500098579703
Sentence: it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .
Perplexity : 2273.8741496221396
Sentence: they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it .
Perplexity : 2442.6376368924043
Sentence: elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .
Perplexity : 2002.762781632247
Sentence: her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .
Perplexity : 2158.1733205925398
Sentence: whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth 's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .
Perplexity : 1826.7610499030748
Sentence: the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .
Perplexity : 2526.3306824789506
Sentence: elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .
Perplexity : 2373.950060392629
Sentence: for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .
Perplexity : 1629.8990285690547
Sentence: this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .
Perplexity : 2568.38241065028
Sentence: with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words `` delightful , '' and `` charming , '' when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .
Perplexity : 2053.551742927709
Sentence: mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .
Perplexity : 2035.2921161482916
Sentence: this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .
Perplexity : 2280.7709163411373
Sentence: `` what will be his surprise , '' thought she , `` when he knows who they are !
Perplexity : 2008.418219870366
Sentence: he takes them now for people of fashion . ''
Perplexity : 2939.374981395305
Sentence: the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .
Perplexity : 1948.0021374835726
Sentence: that he was surprised by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr. gardiner .
Perplexity : 2146.520452164536
Sentence: elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .
Perplexity : 1417.4915439687147
Sentence: the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .
Perplexity : 2263.0858011546115
Sentence: mrs. gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .
Perplexity : 2088.6171457605196
Sentence: her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , `` why is he so altered ?
Perplexity : 2225.5145754323494
Sentence: from what can it proceed ?
Perplexity : 2941.7492246559036
Sentence: it can not be for me , it can not be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .
Perplexity : 1668.5297120915257
Sentence: my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .
Perplexity : 2574.452753026363
Sentence: it is impossible that he should still love me . ''
Perplexity : 1519.3186753262225
Sentence: after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .
Perplexity : 2333.890841364208
Sentence: mr. darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .
Perplexity : 1954.9786375861886
Sentence: after a short silence , the lady first spoke .
Perplexity : 1999.188725627298
Sentence: he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .
Perplexity : 1990.1297340279477
Sentence: elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .
Perplexity : 1894.0736289621482
Sentence: her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingley 's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .
Perplexity : 2147.0695424595356
Sentence: `` there is also one other person in the party , '' he continued after a pause , `` who more particularly wishes to be known to you , will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? ''
Perplexity : 2262.4756770285753

Perplexity : 2115.977878669245
Sentence: it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .
Perplexity : 2305.400492540256
Sentence: never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .

Perplexity : 2408.640246766542

Perplexity : 2060.553462460073

Perplexity : 1586.0796379528078

Perplexity : 1385.9580045469445
Sentence: with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr. darcy afterwards discharged .
Perplexity : 2076.874101184374
Sentence: she certainly did not hate him .

Perplexity : 2270.965430389876
Sentence: the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .

Sentence: but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .

Sentence: gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .
Perplexity : 2446.8021836113658
Sentence: he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .
Perplexity : 2324.589931845027
Sentence: such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .
Perplexity : 2201.5804949394915
Sentence: she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .
Perplexity : 2064.205682774025
Sentence: it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy 's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .
Perplexity : 1875.2176459485772
Sentence: they were , therefore , to go .
Perplexity : 1345.8143987364858

Perplexity : 2057.5139990746825
Sentence: mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast .
Perplexity : 2450.5841072118137

Perplexity : 2219.105673157717
Sentence: georgiana 's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .
Perplexity : 2708.25092108253
Sentence: by mrs. hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .
Perplexity : 1854.2628498479614
Sentence: it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .
Perplexity : 2474.914713207295
Sentence: miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .
Perplexity : 2294.0393899325027
Sentence: elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .
Perplexity : 1412.6797229726735
Sentence: this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .
Perplexity : 2173.185206982381
Sentence: her own thoughts were employing her .
Perplexity : 2944.0848586918955
Sentence: she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .
Perplexity : 1834.4346969375044
Sentence: she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .
Perplexity : 2324.7730192557806
Sentence: after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley 's voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .
Perplexity : 2032.6714216205958
Sentence: she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .
Perplexity : 1873.0011014592346
Sentence: the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .
Perplexity : 2454.4801706603907
Sentence: there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .
Perplexity : 2364.9373217240086
Sentence: while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .
Perplexity : 2162.6689918145203
Sentence: in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley 's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over .
Perplexity : 2125.44223360758
Sentence: miss darcy , on her brother 's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .
Perplexity : 1867.395323751544
Sentence: miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , '' pray , miss eliza , are not the shire militia removed from meryton ?
Perplexity : 2170.977093574449
Sentence: they must be a great loss to your family . ''
Perplexity : 1869.4807727829345
Sentence: in darcy 's presence she dared not mention wickham 's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment 's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .
Perplexity : 2333.3252074201346
Sentence: while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .
Perplexity : 2157.283438241328
Sentence: had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy 's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .
Perplexity : 2292.689630309205
Sentence: to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley 's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .
Perplexity : 2405.0771074507297
Sentence: he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .
Perplexity : 2169.37534614811
Sentence: elizabeth 's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .
Perplexity : 2006.8348739944743
Sentence: her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .
Perplexity : 2170.7079279338973
Sentence: their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress .
Perplexity : 2539.085352225046
Sentence: but georgiana would not join her .
Perplexity : 2944.181696252812
Sentence: her brother 's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .
Perplexity : 2165.8061940767875
Sentence: when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .
Perplexity : 1783.166408530131
Sentence: `` how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy , '' she cried ; `` i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .

Sentence: she is grown so brown and coarse !
Perplexity : 2943.648248977732
Sentence: louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again . ''
Perplexity : 2087.799153235964
Sentence: however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .
Perplexity : 2472.5735749666896
Sentence: `` for my own part , '' she rejoined , `` i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her .
Perplexity : 1787.2281798935676
Sentence: her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .
Perplexity : 2120.686196407637
Sentence: he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , '' i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , 'she a beauty !
Perplexity : 2015.490325767434
Sentence: i should as soon call her mother a wit . '
Perplexity : 2948.4697964884353
Sentence: but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . ''

Sentence: but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .
Perplexity : 2182.5824057567643

Perplexity : 2070.0240233119525
Sentence: would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress .
Perplexity : 2540.587377630294
Sentence: but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .
Perplexity : 2352.423267496286
Sentence: this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister 's having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day . ''
Perplexity : 2233.9177803512944
Sentence: `` oh , yes .

Sentence: be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy .

Perplexity : 2649.44080105038
Sentence: as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .
Perplexity : 2299.1045855454413
Sentence: but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .
Perplexity : 2482.2623870046027
Sentence: be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia 's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .
Perplexity : 2408.8423644452423
Sentence: never , since reading jane 's second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham 's meaning to marry her .
Perplexity : 2450.529557449398
Sentence: no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .
Perplexity : 2049.5897683592916
Sentence: surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement .
Perplexity : 2285.9746158364514
Sentence: while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .
Perplexity : 2430.0473155087498
Sentence: but now it was all too natural .
Perplexity : 2301.881186966834
Sentence: for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .
Perplexity : 2112.3074048192657
Sentence: she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .
Perplexity : 2036.2714435867974
Sentence: sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .
Perplexity : 2715.9497999686246
Sentence: her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .
Perplexity : 2955.5642491542485

Perplexity : 2828.3603484978444
Sentence: how acutely did she now feel it .
Perplexity : 2940.7487861459585
Sentence: she was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle 's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .
Perplexity : 2296.3392192466013
Sentence: though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be deeply affected .
Perplexity : 1699.0939574105905
Sentence: not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr. gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .
Perplexity : 2336.3494501562623
Sentence: elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .

Sentence: they were to be off as soon as possible .

Perplexity : 2573.880055618202
Sentence: `` yes ; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .
Perplexity : 1475.330235990774
Sentence: that is all settled . ''
Perplexity : 1758.9793785142067
Sentence: `` that is all settled ; '' repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .
Perplexity : 1799.3140329291748
Sentence: oh , that i knew how it was ! ''
Perplexity : 1611.6006218487555
Sentence: but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .
Perplexity : 2697.302488880555
Sentence: had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .
Perplexity : 2232.3368383518346
Sentence: an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr. gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn .
Perplexity : 1903.5895993481397
Sentence: `` i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , '' said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; `` and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .
Perplexity : 1666.2830734035022
Sentence: could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ?
Perplexity : 2563.6886141858517
Sentence: his temptation is not adequate to the risk . ''
Perplexity : 2956.285029925578
Sentence: `` do you really think so ? ''
Perplexity : 1670.1761044829163
Sentence: cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .
Perplexity : 1559.3361552423123
Sentence: `` upon my word , '' said mrs. gardiner , `` i begin to be of your uncle 's opinion .
Perplexity : 1065.686724418299
Sentence: it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .
Perplexity : 2171.1540673214686
Sentence: i can not think so very ill of wickham .
Perplexity : 1427.3313047684867
Sentence: can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? ''
Perplexity : 1673.1280296903026
Sentence: `` not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .
Perplexity : 2942.990261364195
Sentence: but of every other neglect i can believe him capable .
Perplexity : 2728.265314948321
Sentence: if , indeed , it should be so !
Perplexity : 1422.262096862857
Sentence: but i dare not hope it .
Perplexity : 2062.3509653628366
Sentence: why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ? ''
Perplexity : 2414.204552382327
Sentence: `` in the first place , '' replied mr. gardiner , `` there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland . ''
Perplexity : 1361.7866641588128
Sentence: and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road . ''
Perplexity : 2579.808545225339
Sentence: `` well , then supposing them to be in london .
Perplexity : 1324.962449964026
Sentence: they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .
Perplexity : 2807.4520257399727
Sentence: `` but why all this secrecy ?
Perplexity : 2506.865336398827
Sentence: why any fear of detection ?
Perplexity : 2656.3638268589234
Sentence: no , no , this is not likely .
Perplexity : 1701.246274459889
Sentence: he can not afford it .
Perplexity : 2347.3891608723666

Perplexity : 2568.232610277169
Sentence: as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .
Perplexity : 2079.6010558125886

Sentence: i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing .

Perplexity : 1992.4705373130987
Sentence: these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .
Perplexity : 2682.270836296892
Sentence: wickham 's affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia 's for him .
Perplexity : 2279.6003737277883
Sentence: she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .

Perplexity : 2025.49334118944

Perplexity : 1672.4378322559135
Sentence: are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? ''
Perplexity : 2645.7658228202527

Sentence: well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss !
Perplexity : 1490.171546916212
Sentence: i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted .
Perplexity : 2031.483861186157
Sentence: and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .
Perplexity : 2486.0901587706544
Sentence: however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham .
Perplexity : 1980.6707044300424
Sentence: `` well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them .
Perplexity : 1750.2071414851946
Sentence: if you 'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight .
Perplexity : 2016.472750397662
Sentence: not one party , or scheme , or any thing .
Perplexity : 1936.0007281332682
Sentence: to be sure london was rather thin , but however the little theatre was open .
Perplexity : 2604.304325505697
Sentence: well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone .
Perplexity : 2203.116235747865
Sentence: and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .
Perplexity : 1492.696023225942
Sentence: well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .
Perplexity : 1757.343398714512
Sentence: but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .
Perplexity : 2241.570940708516
Sentence: however , i recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr. darcy might have done as well . ''
Perplexity : 1948.2483245280719
Sentence: `` mr .
Perplexity : 2939.0
Sentence: darcy ! ''
Perplexity : 1471.7500000000002
Sentence: repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement .
Perplexity : 2964.4349992561956
Sentence: `` oh , yes !
Perplexity : 740.2924351169252
Sentence: but gracious me !
Perplexity : 2939.0
Sentence: i promised them so faithfully !
Perplexity : 2939.2499681077256
Sentence: it was to be such a secret ! ''
Perplexity : 1724.8671367595098
Sentence: `` if it was to be secret , '' said jane , `` say not another word on the subject .
Perplexity : 1195.0270787163988
Sentence: you may depend upon my seeking no further . ''
Perplexity : 2097.467194531933
Sentence: certainly , '' said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; `` we will ask you no questions . ''
Perplexity : 1512.7489141418225
Sentence: on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .
Perplexity : 2159.51572508382
Sentence: but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .
Perplexity : 2153.9355421956247
Sentence: mr. darcy had been at her sister 's wedding .
Perplexity : 1231.8412464216683
Sentence: it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .
Perplexity : 2424.420956479432
Sentence: conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .
Perplexity : 1801.8223157433729
Sentence: those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .
Perplexity : 2691.5183383644676
Sentence: `` you may readily comprehend , '' she added , `` what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .
Perplexity : 1941.2682720962964
Sentence: `` not that i shall though , '' she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; `` and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . ''
Perplexity : 1655.432330289413
Sentence: jane 's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .
Perplexity : 2441.265485196521
Sentence: elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .
Perplexity : 1746.5464685586073
Sentence: she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .
Perplexity : 2117.8129310866684
Sentence: `` gracechurch street , sept. 6 .
Perplexity : 2176.747863722491
Sentence: `` my dear niece , `` i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you .
Perplexity : 1834.8932695513802
Sentence: i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from you .
Perplexity : 2080.118308950672
Sentence: do n't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .
Perplexity : 1736.2868805912092
Sentence: your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .
Perplexity : 2392.139512893493
Sentence: but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit .
Perplexity : 2231.07773984448
Sentence: on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .
Perplexity : 2160.0043048967623
Sentence: mr. darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .
Perplexity : 2083.602001267525
Sentence: he came to tell mr. gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once .
Perplexity : 1976.5811688654735
Sentence: from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .
Perplexity : 2741.830871843887
Sentence: the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .
Perplexity : 2158.1079629944124
Sentence: his character was to speak for itself .
Perplexity : 2754.726866938155
Sentence: he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .
Perplexity : 2117.769577022078
Sentence: if he had another motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him .
Perplexity : 1408.3360077194354
Sentence: he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .
Perplexity : 2008.964280737582
Sentence: there is a lady , it seems , a mrs. younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .
Perplexity : 1858.9879990961072
Sentence: she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .
Perplexity : 2616.5694576701617
Sentence: this mrs. younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .
Perplexity : 1709.9411012460007
Sentence: but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .
Perplexity : 2160.645491045749
Sentence: she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .
Perplexity : 1933.287833419828
Sentence: wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .
Perplexity : 1874.5116111634
Sentence: at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction .
Perplexity : 1704.39350965744
Sentence: they were in street .
Perplexity : 2349.797902282281
Sentence: he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .
Perplexity : 2332.1853825782746
Sentence: his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .
Perplexity : 1919.5194979486068
Sentence: she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham .
Perplexity : 2060.4259610218637
Sentence: she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .
Perplexity : 1823.713366829471
Sentence: he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia 's flight , on her own folly alone .
Perplexity : 2466.9371498969617
Sentence: he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .
Perplexity : 1935.045449027518
Sentence: he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .
Perplexity : 1794.6032832069477
Sentence: but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .
Perplexity : 2510.319713210293
Sentence: under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .
Perplexity : 1458.1649699893164
Sentence: they met several times , for there was much to be discussed .
Perplexity : 2123.6819252899477
Sentence: every thing being settled between them , mr. darcy 's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home .
Perplexity : 1920.8847492272303
Sentence: he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .
Perplexity : 2261.566535647407
Sentence: he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .
Perplexity : 1864.8065897784406
Sentence: on saturday he came again .
Perplexity : 2940.8744608139423
Sentence: your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together .
Perplexity : 1647.6376306717543
Sentence: they met again on sunday , and then i saw him too .
Perplexity : 2089.9273643568094
Sentence: but our visitor was very obstinate .
Perplexity : 2942.093989212556
Sentence: i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .
Perplexity : 2160.2605450614833
Sentence: he has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one .
Perplexity : 2303.4666434455116
Sentence: nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .
Perplexity : 1737.2639967906007
Sentence: but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .
Perplexity : 2318.857040660726
Sentence: but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .
Perplexity : 2210.1686990583767
Sentence: you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people .
Perplexity : 1636.037939850171
Sentence: his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .
Perplexity : 1958.5112150942327
Sentence: it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .
Perplexity : 1887.923401269045
Sentence: perhaps there was some truth in this ; though i doubt whether his reserve , or anybody 's reserve , can be answerable for the event .
Perplexity : 2730.832415917401
Sentence: when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .

Sentence: i believe i have now told you every thing .
Perplexity : 2447.9255359554277

Perplexity : 2279.8345061619025

Perplexity : 1992.634437382346
Sentence: i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .
Perplexity : 2056.0133877047947
Sentence: if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen .
Perplexity : 1500.9224826791867

Sentence: his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire .
Perplexity : 2136.7764978339537

Perplexity : 2341.483509670438
Sentence: pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park .

Perplexity : 2597.3318397199077
Sentence: the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sister 's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !
Perplexity : 2142.757504401072
Sentence: he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .
Perplexity : 2472.04003963335
Sentence: her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .
Perplexity : 1339.1887033745988
Sentence: but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .
Perplexity : 2202.828238077445
Sentence: brother in law of wickham !
Perplexity : 2114.593633992272
Sentence: he had to be sure done much .
Perplexity : 1970.6918284100082

Perplexity : 2362.675822953836

Perplexity : 1991.1424542914879
Sentence: to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley .

Sentence: jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected .
Perplexity : 2410.4831513032495
Sentence: on the gentlemen 's appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .
Perplexity : 2450.960804356557

Sentence: i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .
Perplexity : 1739.2092844035542
Sentence: your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ?
Perplexity : 2771.378305115328
Sentence: supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?
Perplexity : 2399.3398680521427
Sentence: allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged .
Perplexity : 2036.9967406910737
Sentence: you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these .
Perplexity : 2441.8129462579677
Sentence: how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , i can not tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .

Sentence: `` not so hasty , if you please .

Perplexity : 2084.4220740764536
Sentence: and is such a girl to be my nephew 's sister ?
Perplexity : 2379.7984464317638
Sentence: is her husband , is the son of his late father 's steward , to be his brother ?
Perplexity : 1963.871734056138
Sentence: of what are you thinking ?
Perplexity : 2118.356155616343

Perplexity : 1091.1602423535264
Sentence: you refuse , then , to oblige me .

Sentence: you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . ''
Perplexity : 1730.7015081674476
Sentence: `` neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , '' replied elizabeth , `` have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .

Perplexity : 2453.7557480992764
Sentence: i came to try you .
Perplexity : 2658.508196365139
Sentence: in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , '' i take no leave of you , miss bennet .
Perplexity : 1695.9732583658918
Sentence: i send no compliments to your mother .
Perplexity : 2402.1988633841784
Sentence: you deserve no such attention .
Perplexity : 2656.815397514868
Sentence: i am most seriously displeased . ''
Perplexity : 2733.284172662981
Sentence: she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .
Perplexity : 2598.563774650438
Sentence: her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself .
Perplexity : 2554.699588776908
Sentence: `` she did not choose it , '' said her daughter , `` she would go . ''
Perplexity : 1303.4977026486524
Sentence: `` she is a very fine looking woman !
Perplexity : 1445.653559204014
Sentence: and her calling here was prodigiously civil !
Perplexity : 2945.219091368062
Sentence: for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well .
Perplexity : 2066.974812341679
Sentence: she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you .
Perplexity : 2103.30714893223
Sentence: i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 1956.0689996039628
Sentence: elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .
Perplexity : 2444.2578213302686
Sentence: the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .
Perplexity : 2200.244078049795
Sentence: lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 2330.517485683073
Sentence: it was a rational scheme to be sure !
Perplexity : 1651.8378812231624
Sentence: but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .
Perplexity : 2468.1355671828114
Sentence: she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .
Perplexity : 2154.2107450988683
Sentence: and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .
Perplexity : 2373.3243044563333
Sentence: in revolving lady catherine 's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .
Perplexity : 1540.161150553731
Sentence: from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .
Perplexity : 2312.057018428784
Sentence: she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
Perplexity : 2230.3002553549527
Sentence: if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .
Perplexity : 2343.942915035003
Sentence: in that case he would return no more .
Perplexity : 2415.4722847064318
Sentence: lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way .
Perplexity : 2462.8714804739175
Sentence: `` if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , '' she added , `` i shall know how to understand it .
Perplexity : 1632.203701363856
Sentence: i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .
Perplexity : 2758.8641082075956
Sentence: if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all . ''
Perplexity : 1946.290518036964
Sentence: the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs. bennet 's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .
Perplexity : 1764.7363097146963
Sentence: the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .
Perplexity : 1603.3710047229135
Sentence: `` lizzy , '' said he , `` i was going to look for you ; come into my room . ''
Perplexity : 1108.783342193418
Sentence: she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .
Perplexity : 2183.3778558829945
Sentence: it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .
Perplexity : 2148.6187581488875
Sentence: she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .
Perplexity : 1955.26180642696
Sentence: he then said , '' i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .
Perplexity : 1898.588677943797
Sentence: as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .
Perplexity : 2388.198868659212
Sentence: i did not know before , that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .
Perplexity : 1467.220935286911
Sentence: let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . ''
Perplexity : 2721.057932593542
Sentence: the colour now rushed into elizabeth 's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , '' you look conscious .
Perplexity : 2244.7942576739474
Sentence: young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .
Perplexity : 2297.367693242909
Sentence: this letter is from mr .
Perplexity : 2940.1247794998253
Sentence: `` from mr. collins !
Perplexity : 1906.6529343959915
Sentence: `` something very much to the purpose of course .
Perplexity : 2063.794805217557
Sentence: i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .
Perplexity : 2394.1270625201328
Sentence: what relates to yourself , is as follows .
Perplexity : 2473.557880279616
Sentence: `` having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority .
Perplexity : 2384.660214526426
Sentence: your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . ''
Perplexity : 2149.4837008501004
Sentence: `` can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? ''
Perplexity : 1987.4482811303096
Sentence: `` this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .
Perplexity : 2965.137457879004
Sentence: yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman 's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . ''
Perplexity : 2187.204191350086
Sentence: `` have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ?
Perplexity : 1992.1722792070575
Sentence: but now it comes out . ''
Perplexity : 2177.043687857861
Sentence: `` my motive for cautioning you , is as follows .
Perplexity : 2575.5309732840587
Sentence: we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . ''
Perplexity : 2030.104020070096
Sentence: now , lizzy , i think i have surprised you .
Perplexity : 1444.9000185549617
Sentence: it is admirable ! ''
Perplexity : 2965.100849143396
Sentence: never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .
Perplexity : 2232.4999396909398
Sentence: `` are you not diverted ? ''
Perplexity : 2560.8100080757913
Sentence: <s> yes .
Perplexity : 1959.666666666666
Sentence: pray read on . ''
Perplexity : 2039.6366230893698
Sentence: `` after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .
Perplexity : 2373.347426087579
Sentence: i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . ''
Perplexity : 2327.340268687941
Sentence: `` mr. collins moreover adds , '' `` i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .
Perplexity : 2467.374484198449
Sentence: i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .
Perplexity : 2010.8075443310527
Sentence: it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it .
Perplexity : 2263.832501204486
Sentence: `` that is his notion of christian forgiveness !
Perplexity : 2091.5090432016946
Sentence: but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .
Perplexity : 1669.342173959877
Sentence: you are not going to be missish , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .
Perplexity : 1869.0013949212484
Sentence: for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? ''
Perplexity : 2718.0433998934714
Sentence: cried elizabeth , `` i am excessively diverted .
Perplexity : 623.2860741248604
Sentence: but it is so strange ! ''
Perplexity : 1759.3398898468993
Sentence: `` yes that is what makes it amusing .
Perplexity : 2944.9861894577675
Sentence: had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !
Perplexity : 2074.9208645209737
Sentence: much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr. collins 's correspondence for any consideration .
Perplexity : 1917.8613611398202
Sentence: nay , when i read a letter of his , i can not help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law .
Perplexity : 2149.9259819480594
Sentence: and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ?
Perplexity : 2164.6722993777594
Sentence: did she call to refuse her consent ? ''
Perplexity : 2940.3560422389187
Sentence: to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .
Perplexity : 2025.9461727091625
Sentence: it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .
Perplexity : 2180.7362149102973
Sentence: her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr. darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .
Perplexity : 1898.2061503582072
Sentence: instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine 's visit .
Perplexity : 2234.7459912664026
Sentence: the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out .
Perplexity : 2317.8182315467493
Sentence: it was agreed to .
Perplexity : 2597.548927381871
Sentence: bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .
Perplexity : 1742.676566263926
Sentence: they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other .
Perplexity : 2006.4939533450395
Sentence: very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .
Perplexity : 2532.8106299557144
Sentence: they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .
Perplexity : 2415.2665161226514
Sentence: now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , '' mr. darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding your 's .
Perplexity : 1827.0239276748139
Sentence: were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express . ''
Perplexity : 1740.1229347705057
Sentence: `` i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , '' replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , `` that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .
Perplexity : 1727.5578892684725
Sentence: i did not think mrs. gardiner was so little to be trusted . ''
Perplexity : 1871.208401733582
Sentence: `` you must not blame my aunt .
Perplexity : 1950.4102690077164
Sentence: lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars .
Perplexity : 1972.0898095283558
Sentence: let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . ''
Perplexity : 2078.312423906967
Sentence: `` if you will thank me , '' he replied , `` let it be for yourself alone .
Perplexity : 1397.613952353113
Sentence: that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny .
Perplexity : 2120.086924464847
Sentence: but your family owe me nothing .
Perplexity : 2939.5998911583106
Sentence: elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .
Perplexity : 2179.4735816070142
Sentence: if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once .
Perplexity : 2505.619810160277
Sentence: my affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . ''
Perplexity : 2381.56384208605
Sentence: elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .
Perplexity : 2391.1127002658277
Sentence: the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .
Perplexity : 2341.8409689482237
Sentence: had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .
Perplexity : 1929.5903691894357
Sentence: they walked on , without knowing in what direction .
Perplexity : 2319.4458503063693
Sentence: there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .
Perplexity : 1989.2917761304172
Sentence: she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship 's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give .
Perplexity : 2166.5771772835637
Sentence: but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .
Perplexity : 2604.452594579242
Sentence: `` it taught me to hope , '' said he , `` as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .
Perplexity : 1306.698537344043

Perplexity : 1982.903207152544
Sentence: elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .
Perplexity : 1887.1950671747284

Sentence: bingley is most unaffectedly modest .
Perplexity : 2939.499936220873

Perplexity : 2505.7597454104052

Perplexity : 2828.4019010574398

Sentence: at night she opened her heart to jane .
Perplexity : 2775.889266861421

Sentence: that is all to be forgot .
Perplexity : 2320.604781347077
Sentence: but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .
Perplexity : 2540.4475817877565
Sentence: this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself . ''
Perplexity : 2303.3485713801297

Sentence: nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight .

Sentence: and do you really love him quite well enough ?
Perplexity : 2406.27026881088

Sentence: are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? ''
Perplexity : 2428.8400247485124
Sentence: `` oh , yes !
Perplexity : 740.2924351169252

Sentence: let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay .
Perplexity : 2024.7047097444738
Sentence: `` it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began .
Perplexity : 2018.208780352743
Sentence: another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .
Perplexity : 1908.8843055075613
Sentence: how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton !
Perplexity : 2726.90850317652
Sentence: i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you . ''

Perplexity : 1312.609248018536
Sentence: cried mrs. bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , `` if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley !
Perplexity : 1636.6999774701276
Sentence: what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?
Perplexity : 2274.392532908582
Sentence: i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .
Perplexity : 2229.176990882785
Sentence: what shall we do with him ?
Perplexity : 2944.089186559223
Sentence: lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley 's way . ''
Perplexity : 1674.4131624508564
Sentence: elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .
Perplexity : 2652.7310754412906
Sentence: as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , `` mr. bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day ? ''
Perplexity : 2067.818960559463
Sentence: `` i advise mr. darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , '' said mrs. bennet , `` to walk to oakham mount this morning .
Perplexity : 1142.29303920891
Sentence: it is a nice long walk , and mr. darcy has never seen the view . ''
Perplexity : 1787.3390934016118
Sentence: `` it may do very well for the others , '' replied mr. bingley ; `` but i am sure it will be too much for kitty .
Perplexity : 1314.1803553292432
Sentence: darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented .
Perplexity : 2319.7192349667343
Sentence: as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs. bennet followed her , saying , '' i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .
Perplexity : 1950.159275889249
Sentence: but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane 's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .
Perplexity : 1563.1346601514515
Sentence: so , do not put yourself to inconvenience . ''
Perplexity : 2410.78637325545
Sentence: during their walk , it was resolved that mr. bennet 's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .
Perplexity : 1631.3230859210878
Sentence: elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother 's .
Perplexity : 2139.206480378231
Sentence: she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .
Perplexity : 2493.860150177338
Sentence: but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .
Perplexity : 2253.103909519765
Sentence: in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
Perplexity : 1792.6799121785239
Sentence: she did not fear her father 's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .
Perplexity : 1956.9707221297597
Sentence: in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , `` go to your father , he wants you in the library . ''
Perplexity : 2014.3542891516215
Sentence: she was gone directly .
Perplexity : 2593.140983839032

Perplexity : 601.4797439631986
Sentence: are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?
Perplexity : 2397.9424753073545
Sentence: have not you always hated him ? ''
Perplexity : 2388.2232210915754
Sentence: how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
Perplexity : 2772.5564307439117
Sentence: it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 2051.175732223753
Sentence: `` or in other words , you are determined to have him .
Perplexity : 2034.2447691133461
Sentence: but will they make you happy ? ''
Perplexity : 2747.419019568603
Sentence: `` have you any other objection , '' said elizabeth , `` than your belief of my indifference ? ''

Sentence: `` none at all .

Sentence: indeed he has no improper pride .
Perplexity : 2943.4896645771755
Sentence: he is perfectly amiable .
Perplexity : 2251.121577482848
Sentence: you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . ''
Perplexity : 1970.5190322591652

Perplexity : 2273.689399639395
Sentence: but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs. bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .

Sentence: it was very little less .
Perplexity : 1986.2184298851307

Perplexity : 2022.8789583542837

Perplexity : 2978.2739051342182
Sentence: i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlike them .
Perplexity : 2504.429236341635
Sentence: had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .
Perplexity : 2401.8644797022916
Sentence: there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable .
Perplexity : 2309.063410417163
Sentence: to be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love . ''
Perplexity : 2424.547149823777

Perplexity : 2939.499957475762
Sentence: who could have done less for her ?
Perplexity : 2756.348399660368
Sentence: my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .
Perplexity : 2030.2196998096497

Sentence: `` how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it !
Perplexity : 1827.4736761363058
Sentence: but i wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .
Perplexity : 1978.955803437169
Sentence: i wonder when you would have spoken , if i had not asked you !
Perplexity : 1816.3717052838535
Sentence: my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect .
Perplexity : 2940.576296706005
Sentence: too much , i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for i ought not to have mentioned the subject ?
Perplexity : 2104.6282876252153
Sentence: this will never do . ''
Perplexity : 2151.2909809654693
Sentence: `` you need not distress yourself .
Perplexity : 2366.296001243384

Perplexity : 2007.4353769600073
Sentence: `` lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .
Perplexity : 2055.3489717145394
Sentence: was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ?
Perplexity : 2940.8317581459246
Sentence: or had you intended any more serious consequence ? ''
Perplexity : 2939.687383756692
Sentence: `` my real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me .
Perplexity : 2142.1011562118188
Sentence: my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made . ''

Perplexity : 2165.2510357844585

Perplexity : 2083.924540794885
Sentence: you supposed more than really existed .
Perplexity : 2943.784397581535

Sentence: if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight .
Perplexity : 1612.4971073361662
Sentence: mrs. philips 's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though mrs. philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley 's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar .
Perplexity : 2058.2183804457304

Perplexity : 2941.714502505629
Sentence: i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .

Sentence: `` yours , & c. '' as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind .
Perplexity : 2200.966106031279
Sentence: it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .
