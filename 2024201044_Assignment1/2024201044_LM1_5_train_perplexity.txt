Sentence: affectation of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: and so , you like this man 's sisters too , do you ?
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977

Perplexity : 2858.9097100239737
Sentence: elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .
Perplexity : 2902.089259410279
Sentence: they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited .

Sentence: they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .
Perplexity : 2882.217539839014
Sentence: mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it .
Perplexity : 2902.0172399453872
Sentence: mr. bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .
Perplexity : 2902.02343557574
Sentence: his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs. hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .
Perplexity : 2883.7038539069963
Sentence: he did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .

Sentence: between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .
Perplexity : 2902.1562084582724

Sentence: in understanding darcy was the superior .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Perplexity : 2902.2617096333515

Perplexity : 2902.0999844968374
Sentence: darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .
Perplexity : 2819.4169139205796
Sentence: miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .

Sentence: the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .
Perplexity : 2902.0144915414066
Sentence: for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .
Perplexity : 2849.161456492222

Sentence: mr. robinson 's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?
Perplexity : 2902.0781085578446
Sentence: and his answering immediately to the last question oh !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: to be only just tolerable . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` i beg you would not put it into lizzy 's head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .
Perplexity : 2902.138827647158

Sentence: `` i do not believe a word of it , my dear .
Perplexity : 2687.8135375770635
Sentence: but i can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise . ''
Perplexity : 2842.3026338670534
Sentence: `` i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long , '' said miss lucas , `` but i wish he had danced with eliza . ''

Perplexity : 2902.035711429099
Sentence: `` his pride , '' said miss lucas , `` does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .
Perplexity : 2732.8561287551865
Sentence: one can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .
Perplexity : 2902.119981810767
Sentence: if i may so express it , he has a right to be proud . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` that is very true , '' replied elizabeth , `` and i could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . ''
Perplexity : 2580.300645666599
Sentence: `` pride , '' observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , `` is a very common failing i believe .
Perplexity : 2849.0499393886
Sentence: vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: a person may be proud without being vain .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . ''
Perplexity : 2902.029409380263
Sentence: `` if i were as rich as mr. darcy , '' cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , `` i should not care how proud i was .
Perplexity : 2816.261690746391
Sentence: i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . ''

Sentence: miss bennet 's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest .
Perplexity : 2786.601903849099
Sentence: by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother 's admiration .
Perplexity : 2902.0762510271197
Sentence: she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas .
Perplexity : 2676.141571170673
Sentence: `` it may perhaps be pleasant , '' replied charlotte , `` to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .
Perplexity : 2831.778066216533
Sentence: if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .
Perplexity : 2902.0131567911612
Sentence: we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .
Perplexity : 2902.0185169824526
Sentence: bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . ''
Perplexity : 2846.599448801774
Sentence: `` but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .
Perplexity : 2902.0416633766736
Sentence: if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0555513018185
Sentence: `` remember , eliza , that he does not know jane 's disposition as you do . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . ''
Perplexity : 2849.0722463005377
Sentence: but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .
Perplexity : 2902.0263136419812
Sentence: jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .
Perplexity : 2902.035711429099
Sentence: when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . ''
Perplexity : 2902.055546517409
Sentence: as yet , she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .

Sentence: she has known him only a fortnight .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Perplexity : 2902.0769141579735
Sentence: this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . ''
Perplexity : 2902.222202018304
Sentence: `` not as you represent it .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . ''
Perplexity : 2870.4120953265274
Sentence: `` yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0540429194416
Sentence: `` well , '' said charlotte , `` i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .
Perplexity : 2853.5789131240017
Sentence: happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .
Perplexity : 2902.035711429099
Sentence: they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . ''
Perplexity : 2902.054047573742
Sentence: `` you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .
Perplexity : 2902.3499306773174
Sentence: you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0333306534867
Sentence: occupied in observing mr. bingley 's attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .
Perplexity : 2902.1206639543807
Sentence: mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .
Perplexity : 2902.0605988632105
Sentence: but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .
Perplexity : 2902.051275878804
Sentence: to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .
Perplexity : 2864.340573894886
Sentence: of this she was perfectly unaware ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .
Perplexity : 2902.0344770235793
Sentence: he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .
Perplexity : 2902.0217373392884
Sentence: his doing so drew her notice .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: it was at sir william lucas 's , where a large party were assembled .
Perplexity : 2902.0908948547794
Sentence: `` what does mr. darcy mean , '' said she to charlotte , `` by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? ''
Perplexity : 2844.6390105028277
Sentence: `` that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer . ''
Perplexity : 2652.157242880462
Sentence: `` but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about .
Perplexity : 2902.0277755179873
Sentence: he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0869465897367
Sentence: `` with great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . ''
Perplexity : 2902.1785246386976
Sentence: `` you are severe on us . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` it will be her turn soon to be teazed , '' said miss lucas .
Perplexity : 2739.6342129566196
Sentence: always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . ''
Perplexity : 2902.1281638079113
Sentence: on miss lucas 's persevering , however , she added , `` very well ; if it must be so , it must . ''
Perplexity : 2754.694770699145
Sentence: and gravely glancing at mr. darcy , `` there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and i shall keep mine to swell my song . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0499939707897
Sentence: after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .
Perplexity : 2902.0172399453536
Sentence: mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999927
Sentence: elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .
Perplexity : 2885.758666757298
Sentence: `` what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: there is nothing like dancing after all .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . ''
Perplexity : 2902.249937569221
Sentence: `` certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: every savage can dance . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: sir william only smiled .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` your friend performs delightfully ; '' he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group ; `` and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr .
Perplexity : 2797.0952085626823
Sentence: `` you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir . ''
Perplexity : 2902.349810189765
Sentence: `` yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .
Perplexity : 2786.9276205439614
Sentence: do you often dance at st .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` never , sir . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0416633766736
Sentence: `` you have a house in town , i conclude ? ''

Sentence: the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .

Perplexity : 2902.0535565456057
Sentence: i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . ''

Sentence: `` not at all , '' was her answer ; `` but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . ''

Perplexity : 2832.1613319162834
Sentence: lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and mr. collins , in describing the civility of mr. and mrs. philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house .

Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: but jane could think with certainty on only one point , that mr. bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .
Perplexity : 2902.137901646877
Sentence: the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday .
Perplexity : 2879.930382537841
Sentence: mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .

Sentence: `` while i can have my mornings to myself , '' said she , `` it is enough .
Perplexity : 1979.5498324735943
Sentence: elizabeth 's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley 's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening 's amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance .
Perplexity : 2835.2596045326686
Sentence: `` i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , '' said he , `` that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . ''
Perplexity : 2629.2985875337326
Sentence: elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .
Perplexity : 2902.0234315394014
Sentence: if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once .
Perplexity : 2902.035711429066
Sentence: no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia .
Perplexity : 2878.13620995913
Sentence: till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .
Perplexity : 2902.0156236961575
Sentence: the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .
Perplexity : 2719.456106025601
Sentence: but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcy 's pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr. denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , '' i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . ''
Perplexity : 2863.3724653954014
Sentence: this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .
Perplexity : 2873.4483257913266
Sentence: attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .
Perplexity : 2902.1388682878433
Sentence: but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .
Perplexity : 2902.027775517964
Sentence: the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .
Perplexity : 2902.0333306534867
Sentence: mr. collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .
Perplexity : 2902.0270248248103
Sentence: the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .
Perplexity : 2832.38888185624
Sentence: he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her .
Perplexity : 2902.2172123707232

Perplexity : 2758.7014668186152

Sentence: to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: do not wish me such an evil . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0999931089123
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .
Perplexity : 2800.1324071801664
Sentence: they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .
Perplexity : 2849.43726374225
Sentence: he replied , and was again silent .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0399933853614
Sentence: he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .
Perplexity : 2902.038458480308
Sentence: <s> `` very well .
Perplexity : 1935.0000000000005
Sentence: perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but now we may be silent . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: <s> <s> `` sometimes .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: one must speak a little , you know .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . ''
Perplexity : 2902.1409793943667
Sentence: `` are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: `` both , '' replied elizabeth archly ; `` for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .
Perplexity : 2902.299753059178
Sentence: we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . ''
Perplexity : 2901.99999999999

Perplexity : 2801.143490008326
Sentence: she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , `` when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . ''
Perplexity : 2902.078111249099
Sentence: the effect was immediate .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .
Perplexity : 2902.0892701706
Sentence: at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , '' mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0920648114848
Sentence: `` he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , '' replied elizabeth with emphasis , `` and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . ''
Perplexity : 2902.225643141163
Sentence: darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .
Perplexity : 2568.968259764106
Sentence: at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr. darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .
Perplexity : 2875.4368647319734
Sentence: `` i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir .

Sentence: what congratulations will then flow in !

Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william 's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together .

Sentence: recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , '' sir william 's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . ''

Sentence: `` the present always occupies you in such scenes does it ? ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: `` yes , always , '' she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , `` i remember hearing you once say , mr. darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .
Perplexity : 2844.76866961182
Sentence: you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its being created . ''

Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: `` i can readily believe , '' answered he gravely , `` that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . ''
Perplexity : 2855.0697079633137
Sentence: `` but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0333306534867
Sentence: `` i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , '' he coldly replied .
Perplexity : 2902.038458480308
Sentence: she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy 's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .
Perplexity : 2902.0282995868893
Sentence: they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , '' so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !

Sentence: your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr. darcy 's steward .
Perplexity : 2902.130396531744
Sentence: let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr. darcy 's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner .
Perplexity : 2830.2707746060996
Sentence: i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame , that he can not bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .
Perplexity : 2849.25057745929
Sentence: i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ''

Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley .
Perplexity : 2902.0312474764287
Sentence: jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .
Perplexity : 2861.792859788782
Sentence: elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane 's being in the fairest way for happiness .
Perplexity : 2902.0142845189002
Sentence: `` i want to know , '' said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister 's , `` what you have learnt about mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 2622.9365510172374
Sentence: but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` no , '' replied jane , `` i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you .
Perplexity : 2698.339840584155
Sentence: mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister 's , mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
Perplexity : 2861.368720911659
Sentence: i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr. darcy 's regard . ''
Perplexity : 2779.0844029554282
Sentence: `` mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself ? ''
Perplexity : 2738.816219819565
Sentence: `` this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: but what does he say of the living ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0333306534867
Sentence: `` i have not a doubt of mr. bingley 's sincerity , '' said elizabeth warmly ; '' but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
Perplexity : 2813.6662366736123
Sentence: mr. bingley 's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0713969464896
Sentence: she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .
Perplexity : 2902.05262298998
Sentence: elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley 's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .
Perplexity : 2902.07140484762
Sentence: on their being joined by mr. bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr. collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
Perplexity : 2880.337549920701
Sentence: `` i have found out , '' said he , `` by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .
Perplexity : 2439.797869640344
Sentence: i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine .
Perplexity : 2902.1128818069583
Sentence: how wonderfully these sort of things occur !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly !
Perplexity : 2829.778606197111
Sentence: i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .
Perplexity : 2837.4558216169075
Sentence: `` you are not going to introduce yourself to mr .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: <s> <s> darcy ? ''
Perplexity : 1161.4000000000003
Sentence: i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .
Perplexity : 2902.0624952893168
Sentence: i believe him to be lady catherine 's nephew .
Perplexity : 2902.083327351499
Sentence: it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night . ''
Perplexity : 2676.2337237399915
Sentence: mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , '' my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .
Perplexity : 2834.8425710641945
Sentence: pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . ''
Perplexity : 2877.1040034236703
Sentence: and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .
Perplexity : 2902.0172399453872
Sentence: it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr. collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .
Perplexity : 2902.05999200712
Sentence: mr. collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr. darcy 's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .
Perplexity : 2848.001216873651
Sentence: mr. collins then returned to elizabeth .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` i have no reason , i assure you , '' said he , `` to be dissatisfied with my reception .
Perplexity : 1974.9006582009824
Sentence: mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine 's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .
Perplexity : 2869.6905915548164
Sentence: as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .
Perplexity : 2902.0340862155213
Sentence: she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley 's two sisters .
Perplexity : 2902.013512380942
Sentence: her mother 's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .
Perplexity : 2902.019998346153
Sentence: when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr. bingley .
Perplexity : 2902.0238034701224
Sentence: it was an animating subject , and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .
Perplexity : 2833.6897700933346
Sentence: it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane 's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .
Perplexity : 2902.0652000294835
Sentence: it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .
Perplexity : 2902.037497012075
Sentence: she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother 's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy , who sat opposite to them .
Perplexity : 2878.6611452946872
Sentence: `` what is mr. darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ?
Perplexity : 2819.3317285204457
Sentence: i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0238075705697
Sentence: `` for heaven 's sake , madam , speak lower .
Perplexity : 2902.071423297656
Sentence: what advantage can it be to you to offend mr. darcy ?
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .
Perplexity : 2902.1249919244847
Sentence: her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr. darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .
Perplexity : 2902.1585083571154
Sentence: the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: at length however mrs. bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .
Perplexity : 2843.918569010565
Sentence: but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .
Perplexity : 2902.0832914845146
Sentence: by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .
Perplexity : 2902.0609667969875
Sentence: elizabeth 's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .
Perplexity : 2867.161246111159
Sentence: mary 's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected .
Perplexity : 2902.0526275225798
Sentence: elizabeth was in agonies .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley .
Perplexity : 2833.718487205672
Sentence: she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , '' that will do extremely well , child .
Perplexity : 2797.0660048867044
Sentence: you have delighted us long enough .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: others of the party were now applied to .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: `` if i , '' said mr. collins , `` were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .
Perplexity : 2770.391943022247
Sentence: i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .
Perplexity : 2902.0172399453872
Sentence: the rector of a parish has much to do .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .
Perplexity : 2783.767928570657
Sentence: he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible .
Perplexity : 2902.0499918178084
Sentence: and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .
Perplexity : 2816.279648275698
Sentence: i can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: and with a bow to mr. darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .
Perplexity : 2902.104145210976
Sentence: <s> <s> many stared .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .
Perplexity : 2902.108667736954
Sentence: to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .
Perplexity : 2887.7465724562794
Sentence: that his two sisters and mr. darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .
Perplexity : 2902.056811886483
Sentence: the rest of the evening brought her little amusement .
Perplexity : 2586.278467631807
Sentence: in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .
Perplexity : 2902.0227254040346
Sentence: he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .
Perplexity : 2902.0714191966877
Sentence: there was no arguing upon such a project .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good naturedly engaged mr. collins 's conversation to herself .
Perplexity : 2851.3746133626246
Sentence: she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy 's farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .
Perplexity : 2902.1059986352675
Sentence: she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham , and rejoiced in it .
Perplexity : 2902.1874737592548
Sentence: the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .
Perplexity : 2863.611676713504
Sentence: mrs. hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .
Perplexity : 2849.0499393886
Sentence: they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins , who was complimenting mr. bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .
Perplexity : 2882.8477319403078
Sentence: darcy said nothing at all .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: mr. bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: mr. bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .
Perplexity : 2902.1110893151586
Sentence: elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of `` lord , how tired i am ! ''
Perplexity : 2902.0294068473627
Sentence: when at length they arose to take leave , mrs. bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .
Perplexity : 2902.083324480787
Sentence: bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .
Perplexity : 2902.0277755179823
Sentence: mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months .
Perplexity : 2876.1454793855805
Sentence: of having another daughter married to mr. collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .
Perplexity : 2846.599440758033
Sentence: elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield .
Perplexity : 2902.073516411538
Sentence: the next day opened a new scene at longbourn .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: on finding mrs. bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , '' may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? ''
Perplexity : 2882.27636181269
Sentence: before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs. bennet instantly answered , '' oh dear !
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection .
Perplexity : 2902.1922776259103
Sentence: come , kitty , i want you up stairs . ''
Perplexity : 2902.071423297656

Sentence: and upon elizabeth 's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , `` lizzy , i insist upon your staying and hearing mr .
Perplexity : 2860.5957750645
Sentence: elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment 's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .
Perplexity : 2902.0881919052526
Sentence: mrs. bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr. collins began .
Perplexity : 2481.068274964686
Sentence: `` believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .
Perplexity : 2635.4373928078057
Sentence: you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother 's permission for this address .
Perplexity : 2864.3540537644108
Sentence: you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life .
Perplexity : 2902.1562084582724
Sentence: but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did . ''
Perplexity : 2847.864324902251
Sentence: secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness .
Perplexity : 2875.5381614122816
Sentence: twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! )
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977

Perplexity : 2808.407749263474
Sentence: you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999927
Sentence: but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years .
Perplexity : 2863.9186459731427

Sentence: let me do it without farther loss of time .

Sentence: accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . ''
Perplexity : 2792.187807566815
Sentence: `` i am not now to learn , '' replied mr. collins , with a formal wave of the hand , `` that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .
Perplexity : 2864.377916430919
Sentence: i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` upon my word , sir , '' cried elizabeth , `` your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .
Perplexity : 2511.6507657038155
Sentence: i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .
Perplexity : 2805.7039325503774
Sentence: nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0833237631537
Sentence: `` were it certain that lady catherine would think so , '' said mr. collins very gravely `` but i can not imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .
Perplexity : 2861.9457941693336
Sentence: and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . ''
Perplexity : 2824.7202749949593
Sentence: `` indeed , mr. collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .
Perplexity : 2902.149982343173
Sentence: you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say .
Perplexity : 2766.987481421715
Sentence: i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .
Perplexity : 2902.1363159608404
Sentence: in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach .
Perplexity : 2902.0303005782607
Sentence: this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr. collins thus addressed her , '' when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . ''
Perplexity : 2902.059619815241
Sentence: if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . ''
Perplexity : 2902.058813992713
Sentence: `` you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .
Perplexity : 2746.0735731362374
Sentence: my reasons for believing it are briefly these : it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable .
Perplexity : 2902.029409380263
Sentence: my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .
Perplexity : 2840.829684653004
Sentence: your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0263136419812
Sentence: i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .
Perplexity : 2846.5760999430813
Sentence: my feelings in every respect forbid it .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: can i speak plainer ?
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; `` and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . ''
Perplexity : 2867.6850764709334
Sentence: to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .
Perplexity : 2902.0072457616425
Sentence: mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs. bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .
Perplexity : 2869.560172879556
Sentence: this information , however , startled mrs. bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .
Perplexity : 2847.852926704624
Sentence: `` but depend upon it , mr. collins , '' she added , `` that lizzy shall be brought to reason .
Perplexity : 2164.576320937645
Sentence: she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will make her know it . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0476153364552
Sentence: `` pardon me for interrupting you , madam , '' cried mr. collins ; `` but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .
Perplexity : 2902.0816144688943
Sentence: if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . ''
Perplexity : 2902.1619992760116
Sentence: `` lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .
Perplexity : 2738.816219819563
Sentence: in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , '' oh !
Perplexity : 2902.0652125063366
Sentence: mr. bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar .
Perplexity : 2902.0454509860306
Sentence: you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . ''
Perplexity : 2831.8075928818403
Sentence: mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .
Perplexity : 2902.086194811786
Sentence: `` i have not the pleasure of understanding you , '' said he , when she had finished her speech .
Perplexity : 2181.5289001703554
Sentence: `` of what are you talking ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.1249919244847
Sentence: lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins , and mr. collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy . ''
Perplexity : 2902.2631018355733
Sentence: `` and what am i to do on the occasion ?
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: it seems an hopeless business . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . ''
Perplexity : 2439.2807668904775
Sentence: `` let her be called down .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she shall hear my opinion . ''

Sentence: `` i have sent for you on an affair of importance .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i understand that mr. collins has made you an offer of marriage .
Perplexity : 2902.111103667026
Sentence: is it true ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: elizabeth replied that it was .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: `` i have , sir . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: <s> `` very well .

Sentence: <s> <s> bennet ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` yes , or i will never see her again . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0624952893168
Sentence: from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr. collins , and i will never see you again if you do . ''
Perplexity : 2520.7677525392314
Sentence: elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs. bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .
Perplexity : 2865.569338468099
Sentence: `` what do you mean , mr. bennet , by talking in this way ?
Perplexity : 2626.6218629351856
Sentence: you promised me to insist upon her marrying him . ''
Perplexity : 2439.2807668904775

Perplexity : 2902.0238075705697
Sentence: i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . ''
Perplexity : 2812.9592283604206
Sentence: not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs. bennet give up the point .
Perplexity : 2902.194405507465
Sentence: she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ; and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: mr. collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .
Perplexity : 2902.0499961237842
Sentence: he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .
Perplexity : 2902.0185169824526
Sentence: his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother 's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: what do you think has happened this morning ?
Perplexity : 2902.499827794033
Sentence: mr. collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him . ''
Perplexity : 2813.0710588488014
Sentence: charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where mrs. bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .
Perplexity : 2884.8426625144366
Sentence: `` pray do , my dear miss lucas , '' she added in a melancholy tone , '' for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . ''
Perplexity : 2872.9917569244076
Sentence: charlotte 's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth .
Perplexity : 2774.373728028064
Sentence: `` aye , there she comes , '' continued mrs. bennet , `` looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way .
Perplexity : 2777.6834648731874
Sentence: but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .
Perplexity : 2708.221007370546
Sentence: i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you .
Perplexity : 2786.9276122765064
Sentence: i have done with you from this very day .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but it is always so .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: those who do not complain are never pitied . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr. collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , '' now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr. collins and me have a little conversation together . ''
Perplexity : 2902.04999243293
Sentence: in a doleful voice mrs. bennet thus began the projected conversation .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: <s> <s> <s> mr .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: far be it from me , '' he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , `` to resent the behaviour of your daughter .
Perplexity : 2801.548445952959
Sentence: resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned .
Perplexity : 2833.7184748401223
Sentence: perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .
Perplexity : 2902.0217373392675
Sentence: you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .
Perplexity : 2860.486973628287
Sentence: my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: i have certainly meant well through the whole affair .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise . ''
Perplexity : 2902.040535004053
Sentence: the discussion of mr. collins 's offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .
Perplexity : 2902.0588114606585
Sentence: the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennet 's ill humour or ill health .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt 's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed .
Perplexity : 2902.1333076884903
Sentence: `` i found , '' said he , `` as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr. darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . ''
Perplexity : 2651.7173751653518
Sentence: she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .
Perplexity : 2902.0510147042523
Sentence: his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .
Perplexity : 2864.465443813452
Sentence: soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady 's fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister 's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .
Perplexity : 2902.022723446776
Sentence: jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .
Perplexity : 2902.0249979541895
Sentence: when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , '' this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .
Perplexity : 2902.0333306534867
Sentence: the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again .
Perplexity : 2902.0652087620047
Sentence: you shall hear what she says . ''
Perplexity : 2902.1249919244847
Sentence: she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr. hurst had a house .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999873
Sentence: the next was in these words .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .
Perplexity : 2849.5271638525514
Sentence: i depend on you for that . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley 's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .
Perplexity : 2785.685646618815
Sentence: `` it is unlucky , '' said she , after a short pause , `` that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .
Perplexity : 2453.243599699418
Sentence: but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?
Perplexity : 2902.0348749181353
Sentence: mr. bingley will not be detained in london by them . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i will read it to you '' when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .
Perplexity : 2849.7607693181226
Sentence: many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i despair .
Perplexity : 2902.0571311166686
Sentence: i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you . ''
Perplexity : 2901.999999999985
Sentence: `` it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` why will you think so ?

Sentence: i will have no reserves from you . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0999931089123
Sentence: i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999773
Sentence: i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .
Perplexity : 2833.9766406576414
Sentence: my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister 's partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman 's heart .
Perplexity : 2902.04463474201
Sentence: with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? ''

Sentence: said jane as she finished it .

Sentence: `` is it not clear enough ?
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother 's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! )

Sentence: but the case is this .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but , my dearest jane , you can not seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend .

Perplexity : 2693.6010580282077
Sentence: `` you must decide for yourself , '' said elizabeth , `` and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him . ''

Perplexity : 2902.0499961237842
Sentence: she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .
Perplexity : 2851.4600100704743
Sentence: jane 's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .
Perplexity : 2902.142737726428
Sentence: they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman 's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .
Perplexity : 2902.0967424782084
Sentence: after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .
Perplexity : 2902.0535642327177
Sentence: the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins .
Perplexity : 2902.1851591938353
Sentence: elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Perplexity : 2277.353480346809
Sentence: charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .
Perplexity : 2902.0714109962205
Sentence: this was very amiable , but charlotte 's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of mr. collins 's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .
Perplexity : 2902.0384518565224
Sentence: such was miss lucas 's scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon .
Perplexity : 2868.7586543577695
Sentence: but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet .
Perplexity : 2902.0124989501833
Sentence: his reception however was of the most flattering kind .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .
Perplexity : 2902.1086770927977
Sentence: but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: in as short a time as mr. collins 's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .
Perplexity : 2807.692780329342
Sentence: the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .
Perplexity : 2902.009999155824
Sentence: sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .
Perplexity : 2840.958397661709
Sentence: lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr. collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st. james 's .
Perplexity : 2849.8770524326696
Sentence: the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte 's dying an old maid .

Sentence: charlotte herself was tolerably composed .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: her reflections were in general satisfactory .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: mr. collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .
Perplexity : 2902.0238075705697
Sentence: but still he would be her husband .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999823
Sentence: this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .
Perplexity : 2825.7873186610223
Sentence: the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .
Perplexity : 2902.039993385364
Sentence: elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .
Perplexity : 2855.4902540465405
Sentence: she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr. collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .
Perplexity : 2865.5384889072757
Sentence: as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs. bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .
Perplexity : 2902.064501566525
Sentence: `` my dear madam , '' he replied , `` this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . ''
Perplexity : 2672.4985894540314
Sentence: you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` my dear sir , '' replied mr. collins , `` i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship 's concurrence . ''
Perplexity : 2726.3219092155446
Sentence: `` you can not be too much on your guard .
Perplexity : 2585.1265397349503
Sentence: risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . ''
Perplexity : 2902.104624013799
Sentence: `` believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire .
Perplexity : 2812.748377109654
Sentence: mrs. bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her 's , he might become a very agreeable companion .
Perplexity : 2902.0446378171646
Sentence: but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .
Perplexity : 2902.0454509860306
Sentence: miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before .
Perplexity : 2902.222139850295
Sentence: my dear charlotte , impossible ! ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman 's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.035711429099
Sentence: `` i see what you are feeling , '' replied charlotte , `` you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you .
Perplexity : 2822.042197409521
Sentence: but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done .
Perplexity : 2747.150680911258
Sentence: i am not romantic you know .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr. collins 's character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . ''
Perplexity : 2855.6871616918074
Sentence: elizabeth quietly answered `` undoubtedly ; '' and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .
Perplexity : 2837.6864628296194
Sentence: charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .
Perplexity : 2758.8499362493453
Sentence: it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: the strangeness of mr. collins 's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .
Perplexity : 2792.2565045223864
Sentence: she had always felt that charlotte 's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .
Perplexity : 2902.131543407418
Sentence: charlotte the wife of mr. collins , was a most humiliating picture !
Perplexity : 2902.388843168154
Sentence: and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .
Perplexity : 2867.6560151386734
Sentence: elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .
Perplexity : 2845.249557499191
Sentence: with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , '' good lord !
Perplexity : 2883.7038565807525
Sentence: sir william , how can you tell such a story ?
Perplexity : 2902.142836050013
Sentence: do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william 's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .
Perplexity : 2879.4980790567365
Sentence: elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr. collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .
Perplexity : 2855.382091879179
Sentence: in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .
Perplexity : 2847.2403840661123
Sentence: two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .
Perplexity : 2879.1655198452786
Sentence: nothing could console and nothing appease her .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: nor did that day wear out her resentment .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .
Perplexity : 2902.0124989501833
Sentence: mr. bennet 's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !
Perplexity : 2869.82463507041
Sentence: jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .
Perplexity : 2902.0454509860306
Sentence: kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr. collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton .
Perplexity : 2866.621660219474
Sentence: lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs. bennet 's sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .
Perplexity : 2902.0089278160435
Sentence: between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .
Perplexity : 2902.035708353423
Sentence: her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .
Perplexity : 2902.03844854576
Sentence: jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .
Perplexity : 2846.5527472534154
Sentence: the promised letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth 's abode in the family might have prompted .
Perplexity : 2866.591731926472
Sentence: after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .
Perplexity : 2876.8896200246845
Sentence: mr. collins 's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet .
Perplexity : 2902.038458480308
Sentence: on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .
Perplexity : 2902.0249979542255
Sentence: such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley 's continued absence .
Perplexity : 2846.78619430256
Sentence: neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .
Perplexity : 2902.0416526142403
Sentence: even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane 's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .
Perplexity : 2861.945680136564
Sentence: the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .
Perplexity : 2902.0131567911612
Sentence: but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .
Perplexity : 2902.0212748409895
Sentence: it needed all jane 's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .
Perplexity : 2902.019998346153
Sentence: he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company .
Perplexity : 2902.2585208805194
Sentence: the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .
Perplexity : 2902.0156236961575
Sentence: mrs. bennet was really in a most pitiable state .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .
Perplexity : 2902.0185169824526
Sentence: the sight of miss lucas was odious to her .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr. bennet were dead .
Perplexity : 2881.6737891547928
Sentence: `` indeed , mr. bennet , '' said she , `` it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! ''
Perplexity : 2403.441978833786
Sentence: `` my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .

Sentence: let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , '' i can not bear to think that they should have all this estate .
Perplexity : 2869.649416271433
Sentence: if it was not for the entail i should not mind it . ''
Perplexity : 2786.8316040189134
Sentence: `` let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` i never can be thankful , mr. bennet , for any thing about the entail .
Perplexity : 2902.153797239606
Sentence: how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one 's own daughters i can not understand ; and all for the sake of mr. collins too !
Perplexity : 2902.1427837986894
Sentence: why should he have it more than anybody else ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: miss darcy 's praise occupied the chief of it .
Perplexity : 2902.083327351499
Sentence: her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother 's being an inmate of mr. darcy 's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .
Perplexity : 2864.465427380891

Sentence: but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley 's being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .
Perplexity : 2817.8931139061765
Sentence: it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane 's attractions .

Sentence: miss bennet accepted her aunt 's invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline 's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .

Perplexity : 2902.0319104876708
Sentence: without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .
Perplexity : 2902.04629108284

Perplexity : 2808.447957888437
Sentence: seriously , i would have you be on your guard .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte 's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .

Sentence: while sir william was with them , mr. collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .

Perplexity : 2902.0657800197205
Sentence: she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne 's .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0769108456643
Sentence: elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin 's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .

Sentence: as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr. darcy , and mr. darcy only , entered the room .
Perplexity : 2902.205283690202
Sentence: they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , '' how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 2902.080340570524
Sentence: it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before .

Sentence: `` perfectly so i thank you . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0277755179873
Sentence: `` if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .
Perplexity : 2902.088218903975
Sentence: but perhaps mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . ''
Perplexity : 2867.68507396887
Sentence: `` i should not be surprised , '' said darcy , `` if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . ''
Perplexity : 2625.890656117344
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer .
Perplexity : 2903.500000000001

Sentence: `` i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . ''
Perplexity : 2841.009927053169
Sentence: `` mr. collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0999931089123
Sentence: `` yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .
Perplexity : 2902.0302979686035
Sentence: my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did .
Perplexity : 2902.0227254040346
Sentence: she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . ''
Perplexity : 2902.1999251000993
Sentence: `` it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0249979542255
Sentence: it is nearly fifty miles . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: little more than half a day 's journey .
Perplexity : 2902.199972438503
Sentence: yes , i call it a very easy distance . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , '' cried elizabeth .

Sentence: `` it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire .
Perplexity : 2902.374830506641
Sentence: any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far . ''
Perplexity : 2902.4611713768986
Sentence: as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , '' i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .
Perplexity : 2879.068337392109
Sentence: the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .
Perplexity : 2902.0416633766736
Sentence: where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but that is not the case here .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , `` you can not have a right to such very strong local attachment .
Perplexity : 2851.5454240525087
Sentence: you can not have been always at longbourn . ''
Perplexity : 2902.16665709564
Sentence: a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .

Perplexity : 2902.16665709564

Perplexity : 2858.7820849943855
Sentence: `` what can be the meaning of this ! ''
Perplexity : 2369.813268155813
Sentence: said charlotte , as soon as he was gone .
Perplexity : 2492.574479712265
Sentence: `` my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . ''
Perplexity : 2812.125054058604
Sentence: but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte 's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .
Perplexity : 2902.008619959857
Sentence: all field sports were over .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen can not be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .
Perplexity : 2902.0491680394152

Sentence: colonel fitzwilliam 's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .
Perplexity : 2882.8395676048804
Sentence: she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success .
Perplexity : 2902.0588139927186
Sentence: it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend 's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .
Perplexity : 2887.004770888878
Sentence: in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: yet it did , and even a third .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: it seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999823
Sentence: he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collins 's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too .
Perplexity : 2876.9066782682567
Sentence: his words seemed to imply it .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage .
Perplexity : 2902.3247965925566
Sentence: she was engaged one day as she walked , in re perusing jane 's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .
Perplexity : 2902.058815681313
Sentence: putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , '' i did not know before that you ever walked this way . ''
Perplexity : 2718.6224640891423
Sentence: `` i have been making the tour of the park , '' he replied , `` as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage .

Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` but so we all do .

Sentence: <s> i speak feelingly .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Perplexity : 2819.3317464465194
Sentence: now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ?
Perplexity : 2902.0454509860306
Sentence: `` these are home questions and perhaps i can not say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money .
Perplexity : 2902.0416633766736
Sentence: younger sons can not marry where they like . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: `` our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` is this , '' thought elizabeth , `` meant for me ? ''
Perplexity : 2526.59886836228
Sentence: and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , `` and pray , what is the usual price of an earl 's younger son ?
Perplexity : 2902.049996123787
Sentence: unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , '' i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .
Perplexity : 2840.9197822561428
Sentence: but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . ''

Sentence: i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy . ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: `` are you , indeed ?

Sentence: and pray what sort of guardians do you make ?
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: does your charge give you much trouble ?
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . ''
Perplexity : 2861.7588579190565
Sentence: as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .
Perplexity : 2874.8335331231197
Sentence: she directly replied , '' you need not be frightened .
Perplexity : 2902.071423297656
Sentence: i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .

Sentence: their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy 's . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant .
Perplexity : 2837.4150878105966
Sentence: it was all conjecture . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady 's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . ''
Perplexity : 2867.7722197018597
Sentence: `` you may depend upon my not mentioning it . ''
Perplexity : 2341.352667294804
Sentence: `` and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley .
Perplexity : 2902.083327351499
Sentence: what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . ''
Perplexity : 2902.013887725739
Sentence: `` did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: `` and what arts did he use to separate them ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .
Perplexity : 2531.5660044226124
Sentence: after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .
Perplexity : 2902.090902683912
Sentence: `` i am thinking of what you have been telling me , '' said she .
Perplexity : 2690.083962133518
Sentence: `` your cousin 's conduct does not suit my feelings .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: why was he to be the judge ? ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: `` you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` but , '' she continued , recollecting herself , `` as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .
Perplexity : 2788.890398851528
Sentence: it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . ''
Perplexity : 2648.535953016986
Sentence: `` that is not an unnatural surmise , '' said fitzwilliam , `` but it is lessening the honour of my cousin 's triumph very sadly . ''
Perplexity : 2725.948352738658
Sentence: this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr. darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .
Perplexity : 2874.960206833322
Sentence: there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .
Perplexity : 2853.834604100564
Sentence: it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .
Perplexity : 2416.8007838509234
Sentence: there could not exist in the world two men , over whom mr. darcy could have such boundless influence .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr. bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .
Perplexity : 2866.7563298066957
Sentence: if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .
Perplexity : 2866.621660219474
Sentence: he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .
Perplexity : 2837.9271493802835
Sentence: `` there were some very strong objections against the lady , '' were colonel fitzwilliam 's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999873
Sentence: `` to jane herself , '' she exclaimed , `` there could be no possibility of objection .
Perplexity : 2902.071417146231
Sentence: all loveliness and goodness as she is !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .
Perplexity : 2902.0555513018185
Sentence: neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0151502495823
Sentence: when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr. darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend 's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister .
Perplexity : 2889.2570072149647
Sentence: the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .
Perplexity : 2902.020406477078
Sentence: mrs. collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr. collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine 's being rather displeased by her staying at home .
Perplexity : 2902.141237606118
Sentence: when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent .
Perplexity : 2842.407005649583
Sentence: they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: mr. darcy 's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister 's sufferings .
Perplexity : 2849.139171928754
Sentence: it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .
Perplexity : 2858.7912055893357
Sentence: she could not think of darcy 's leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .
Perplexity : 2902.0833112070113
Sentence: but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr. darcy walk into the room .
Perplexity : 2828.5379027022004
Sentence: in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .
Perplexity : 2902.0227254040346
Sentence: she answered him with cold civility .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .
Perplexity : 2667.0800757441752
Sentence: elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .
Perplexity : 2712.8368535318236
Sentence: after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , '' in vain have i struggled .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you . ''
Perplexity : 2805.663656878999
Sentence: she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .
Perplexity : 2902.178496973214
Sentence: he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .
Perplexity : 2902.0975353106664
Sentence: as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .
Perplexity : 2902.0999758867347
Sentence: he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , '' in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .
Perplexity : 2880.41103085765
Sentence: it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you .
Perplexity : 2902.055546517409
Sentence: but i can not i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .
Perplexity : 2902.117608920545
Sentence: i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .
Perplexity : 2902.285629932329
Sentence: it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration .
Perplexity : 2902.1428299005606
Sentence: his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .
Perplexity : 2902.0714191967086
Sentence: the pause was to elizabeth 's feelings dreadful .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , '' and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !
Perplexity : 2902.115363721654
Sentence: i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: but it is of small importance . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` i might as well enquire , '' replied she , `` why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?
Perplexity : 2902.011626928651
Sentence: was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil ?
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: but i have other provocations .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: you know i have .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0192291764174
Sentence: as she pronounced these words , mr. darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .
Perplexity : 2902.019998346153
Sentence: `` i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .
Perplexity : 2902.1999638290963
Sentence: no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: you dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . ''
Perplexity : 2881.86909536926
Sentence: he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .
Perplexity : 2758.8202765041683
Sentence: `` can you deny that you have done it ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.071423297656
Sentence: <s> <s> she repeated .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: with assumed tranquillity he then replied , `` i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success .
Perplexity : 2867.873884746682
Sentence: towards him i have been kinder than towards myself . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: `` but it is not merely this affair , '' she continued , `` on which my dislike is founded .
Perplexity : 2578.063558673499
Sentence: long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .
Perplexity : 2902.0499961237842
Sentence: your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: on this subject , what can you have to say ?
Perplexity : 2902.285629932329
Sentence: in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: `` who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0333306534867
Sentence: `` his misfortunes ! ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: repeated darcy contemptuously ; `` yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0454509860306
Sentence: `` and of your infliction , '' cried elizabeth with energy .
Perplexity : 2902.4372693255223
Sentence: `` you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .
Perplexity : 2813.0337858062717
Sentence: you have done all this !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` and this , '' cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , '' is your opinion of me !
Perplexity : 2846.6461591615807
Sentence: i thank you for explaining it so fully .
Perplexity : 2902.0999931089123
Sentence: my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but perhaps , '' added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , `` these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .
Perplexity : 2875.4030889782393
Sentence: these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999873
Sentence: but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: they were natural and just .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?
Perplexity : 2902.0555513018185
Sentence: to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , '' you are mistaken , mr. darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ''
Perplexity : 2819.303965170638
Sentence: she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , '' you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0657845523406
Sentence: again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .
Perplexity : 2902.1874737574017
Sentence: <s> she went on .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry . ''
Perplexity : 2889.6876534951216
Sentence: i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .
Perplexity : 2902.068172831455
Sentence: the tumult of her mind was now painfully great .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .
Perplexity : 2767.099589753412
Sentence: her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .
Perplexity : 2902.0999931089145
Sentence: that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr. darcy !
Perplexity : 2902.1249919244847
Sentence: that he should have been in love with her for so many months !
Perplexity : 2902.249937569221
Sentence: so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend 's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !
Perplexity : 2902.1190131571498
Sentence: it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .
Perplexity : 2902.0624952893168
Sentence: but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr. wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .
Perplexity : 2902.0434735932704
Sentence: she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine 's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte 's observation , and hurried her away to her room .
Perplexity : 2902.0806115639293
Sentence: elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .
Perplexity : 2902.066655948473
Sentence: she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr. darcy 's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .
Perplexity : 2902.1124473021086
Sentence: the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .
Perplexity : 2902.12900734489
Sentence: the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .
Perplexity : 2902.034479993194
Sentence: she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr. darcy , she was directly retreating .
Perplexity : 2855.687155781514
Sentence: but the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , `` i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .
Perplexity : 2902.170650646814
Sentence: will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .
Perplexity : 2902.0588139927186
Sentence: with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand .
Perplexity : 2902.0124989501833
Sentence: the envelope itself was likewise full .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .
Perplexity : 2902.0624952893168
Sentence: i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .
Perplexity : 2883.1556370959925
Sentence: you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice .
Perplexity : 2902.03332778286
Sentence: wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .
Perplexity : 2885.7793817846573
Sentence: if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your 's , i can only say that i am sorry .
Perplexity : 2902.0147046528755
Sentence: the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country .
Perplexity : 2902.068957426413
Sentence: but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .
Perplexity : 2843.881846142449
Sentence: i had often seen him in love before .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas 's accidental information , that bingley 's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .
Perplexity : 2902.0714191966877
Sentence: he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: from that moment i observed my friend 's behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him .
Perplexity : 2902.0178556596165
Sentence: your sister i also watched .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening 's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .
Perplexity : 2902.0744498020263
Sentence: your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .
Perplexity : 2851.353251712272
Sentence: but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister 's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .
Perplexity : 2876.013494215454
Sentence: that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .
Perplexity : 2902.0178556596165
Sentence: i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ; i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason .
Perplexity : 2902.039993385364
Sentence: my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .
Perplexity : 2902.0217373392675
Sentence: but there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .
Perplexity : 2902.013887725757
Sentence: these causes must be stated , though briefly .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: the situation of your mother 's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .
Perplexity : 2843.820605871346
Sentence: <s> <s> pardon me .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: it pains me to offend you .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .
Perplexity : 2902.022725404001
Sentence: i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .
Perplexity : 2902.011903760855
Sentence: the part which i acted , is now to be explained .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i described , and enforced them earnestly .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister 's indifference .
Perplexity : 2902.0581270987354
Sentence: he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .
Perplexity : 2902.2498969978287
Sentence: to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .
Perplexity : 2902.0263136419917
Sentence: i can not blame myself for having done thus much .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town .
Perplexity : 2902.0581331063854
Sentence: i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .
Perplexity : 2902.0263136419917
Sentence: that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .
Perplexity : 2902.0178556596165
Sentence: perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .
Perplexity : 2902.083327351499
Sentence: if i have wounded your sister 's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them .
Perplexity : 2902.073516411538
Sentence: with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr. wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .
Perplexity : 2902.0666588191298
Sentence: of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education .
Perplexity : 2902.0131567911612
Sentence: as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr. darcy could not have .
Perplexity : 2879.574383683605
Sentence: here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: it adds even another motive .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .
Perplexity : 2902.0373066029315
Sentence: there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .
Perplexity : 2902.16665709564
Sentence: he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .
Perplexity : 2902.068957426413
Sentence: i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman .
Perplexity : 2902.0624952893168
Sentence: the business was therefore soon settled .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .
Perplexity : 2902.034479993194
Sentence: all connection between us seemed now dissolved .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .
Perplexity : 2902.0588190585704
Sentence: his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .
Perplexity : 2829.504633697043
Sentence: he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions .
Perplexity : 2902.0241901762033
Sentence: you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .
Perplexity : 2855.4116118025486
Sentence: about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .
Perplexity : 2902.039119841942
Sentence: she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .
Perplexity : 2902.0333306534867
Sentence: i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .
Perplexity : 2902.0499896655665
Sentence: you may imagine what i felt and how i acted .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge .
Perplexity : 2902.0303005782607
Sentence: mr. wickham 's chief object was unquestionably my sister 's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .
Perplexity : 2902.11760892054
Sentence: his revenge would have been complete indeed .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 2873.695879715595
Sentence: i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .
Perplexity : 2902.0217373392884
Sentence: you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .
Perplexity : 2902.0499961237842
Sentence: but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .
Perplexity : 2902.066661689789
Sentence: for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .
Perplexity : 2879.0780546475753
Sentence: if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .
Perplexity : 2822.528033129077
Sentence: i will only add , god bless you .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: if elizabeth , when mr. darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .
Perplexity : 2902.013512380942
Sentence: with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield .
Perplexity : 2902.0277755179873
Sentence: she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .
Perplexity : 2869.539579009171
Sentence: his belief of her sister 's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .
Perplexity : 2902.0394637543654
Sentence: he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .
Perplexity : 2902.0277755179873
Sentence: it was all pride and insolence .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .
Perplexity : 2902.015871691974
Sentence: astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , `` this must be false !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: this can not be !
Perplexity : 1935.0000000000005
Sentence: this must be the grossest falsehood ! ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .
Perplexity : 2902.087485170571
Sentence: the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .
Perplexity : 2872.8434411095013
Sentence: so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .
Perplexity : 2902.0588190585704
Sentence: but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham 's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999795
Sentence: again she read on .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr. darcy 's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .
Perplexity : 2902.0531690779844
Sentence: the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr. wickham 's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .
Perplexity : 2902.0161276877575
Sentence: she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .
Perplexity : 2872.0616529596205
Sentence: of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .
Perplexity : 2902.015871691974
Sentence: but no such recollection befriended her .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: <s> but , alas !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin 's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .

Perplexity : 2902.035711429099
Sentence: mrs. bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .

Sentence: their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .

Perplexity : 2873.4907094588043
Sentence: mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire .

Perplexity : 2902.111098882522
Sentence: in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy 's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .
Perplexity : 2879.0488879071036

Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .
Perplexity : 2902.038458480308

Perplexity : 2866.726392380192
Sentence: mrs. reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father 's life time .
Perplexity : 2902.076917470285

Perplexity : 2902.0714140715786
Sentence: the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds was of no trifling nature .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977

Sentence: how much of good or evil must be done by him !
Perplexity : 2902.0624952893168
Sentence: every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .
Perplexity : 2902.015871691974
Sentence: as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .
Perplexity : 2902.083269984053

Perplexity : 2902.0249979542255
Sentence: had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr. darcy , the gardener 's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .
Perplexity : 2902.011110175272
Sentence: they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .
Perplexity : 2902.025638930232
Sentence: amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .
Perplexity : 2902.009258476428
Sentence: she was overpowered by shame and vexation .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world !
Perplexity : 2902.1153570980846
Sentence: in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: why did she come ?
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .
Perplexity : 2902.04166098447
Sentence: she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .
Perplexity : 2902.0624952893168
Sentence: and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ?
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing 's park , when he put his letter into her hand !
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .
Perplexity : 2902.0999931089123
Sentence: they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .
Perplexity : 2812.8484657190775
Sentence: her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr. darcy then was .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .
Perplexity : 2902.007935835118
Sentence: with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .
Perplexity : 2902.208251119697
Sentence: it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .
Perplexity : 2902.039470552453
Sentence: they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it .
Perplexity : 2902.0087711874526
Sentence: elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .
Perplexity : 2835.067494653051
Sentence: her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .
Perplexity : 2887.7283775136525
Sentence: whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth 's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .
Perplexity : 2902.025638930232
Sentence: the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .
Perplexity : 2902.029409380263
Sentence: for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .
Perplexity : 2771.1412601088186
Sentence: this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words `` delightful , '' and `` charming , '' when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .
Perplexity : 2902.07636179276
Sentence: her colour changed , and she said no more .
Perplexity : 2902.16665709564
Sentence: mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .
Perplexity : 2858.800326213445
Sentence: this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .
Perplexity : 2902.034082301706
Sentence: he takes them now for people of fashion . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .
Perplexity : 2902.124952473718
Sentence: it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .
Perplexity : 2902.0588139927186
Sentence: she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .
Perplexity : 2902.110095007653
Sentence: mrs. gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .
Perplexity : 2786.196650277184
Sentence: elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: from what can it proceed ?
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: it can not be for me , it can not be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .
Perplexity : 2767.2677173283437
Sentence: my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: it is impossible that he should still love me . ''
Perplexity : 2902.071423297656
Sentence: mr. darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .
Perplexity : 2902.090902683912
Sentence: after a short silence , the lady first spoke .
Perplexity : 2902.166642741848
Sentence: she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected `` for your housekeeper , '' she added , `` informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . ''
Perplexity : 2729.80007334345
Sentence: he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .
Perplexity : 2865.677224297141
Sentence: elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .
Perplexity : 2622.4789052471306
Sentence: her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingley 's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .
Perplexity : 2902.0588114606585
Sentence: `` there is also one other person in the party , '' he continued after a pause , `` who more particularly wishes to be known to you , will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? ''
Perplexity : 2833.6801961383694
Sentence: the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .
Perplexity : 2902.0227254040346
Sentence: she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .
Perplexity : 2902.0212748409895
Sentence: they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .
Perplexity : 2851.566706281605
Sentence: he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .

Sentence: at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .
Perplexity : 2751.5032344250076

Sentence: at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance .
Perplexity : 2902.055546517409

Perplexity : 2902.0238075705697
Sentence: on mr. and mrs. gardiner 's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .

Sentence: the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr. darcy 's civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .

Perplexity : 2902.0277755179873
Sentence: she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .

Sentence: on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .

Sentence: he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it `` was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; '' and , before she could reply , he added , `` it is above eight months .

Perplexity : 2902.086946589734
Sentence: it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .
Perplexity : 2901.999999999985
Sentence: when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .

Sentence: never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .

Perplexity : 2824.655401159531

Perplexity : 2880.3926659840085
Sentence: elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .
Perplexity : 2902.124925957228

Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr. darcy afterwards discharged .
Perplexity : 2902.048383332117

Perplexity : 2902.0096145722664
Sentence: no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .
Perplexity : 2902.115327307421
Sentence: the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .
Perplexity : 2902.080610182027
Sentence: gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .
Perplexity : 2902.0405303497714
Sentence: she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .
Perplexity : 2885.2746695116534
Sentence: it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy 's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .

Perplexity : 2902.07574421066
Sentence: georgiana 's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999823
Sentence: mrs. gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .
Perplexity : 2902.0833201748105
Sentence: by mrs. hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .
Perplexity : 2809.9140257215445
Sentence: it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .
Perplexity : 2902.0377312189744

Sentence: she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .
Perplexity : 2902.0908948547794
Sentence: there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999927
Sentence: while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .
Perplexity : 2902.1090632124065
Sentence: he had been some time with mr. gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .
Perplexity : 2902.0454509860124
Sentence: no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .
Perplexity : 2866.644106000232
Sentence: in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley 's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over .
Perplexity : 2902.0799821570217
Sentence: miss darcy , on her brother 's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .
Perplexity : 2875.526892705509
Sentence: miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , '' pray , miss eliza , are not the shire militia removed from meryton ?
Perplexity : 2902.0810612656137
Sentence: they must be a great loss to your family . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: in darcy 's presence she dared not mention wickham 's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment 's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .
Perplexity : 2901.999999999967
Sentence: had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy 's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .
Perplexity : 2902.0178525843075
Sentence: not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy 's meditated elopement .
Perplexity : 2902.0499961237842

Perplexity : 2902.073144353613
Sentence: her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .
Perplexity : 2902.04761533644
Sentence: but georgiana would not join her .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: her brother 's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .
Perplexity : 2902.012819436794
Sentence: when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .
Perplexity : 2902.043474841402
Sentence: `` how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy , '' she cried ; `` i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .
Perplexity : 2709.747064939758
Sentence: she is grown so brown and coarse !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .
Perplexity : 2902.0285666475847
Sentence: `` for my own part , '' she rejoined , `` i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her .
Perplexity : 2843.8573532511646
Sentence: her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .

Sentence: her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines .
Perplexity : 2902.0555513018185
Sentence: they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0483833321555
Sentence: persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .
Perplexity : 2902.011903760855
Sentence: i should as soon call her mother a wit . '
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0277755179873
Sentence: `` yes , '' replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , `` but that was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . ''
Perplexity : 2800.0979596279903
Sentence: he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .

Sentence: the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .
Perplexity : 2902.0249979542255
Sentence: they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner thought of him , and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece 's beginning the subject .
Perplexity : 2902.0217373392675
Sentence: elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .
Perplexity : 2870.4254594758063
Sentence: elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill. they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .
Perplexity : 2828.9881598871893

Perplexity : 2902.011110175272
Sentence: as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .

Sentence: but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .
Perplexity : 2902.0058134585042
Sentence: never , since reading jane 's second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham 's meaning to marry her .

Sentence: while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .
Perplexity : 2902.022725404014
Sentence: but now it was all too natural .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .

Sentence: she was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle 's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .
Perplexity : 2902.0170440363386
Sentence: mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant 's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .
Perplexity : 2902.1120036101197
Sentence: not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr. gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .

Sentence: oh , that i knew how it was ! ''
Perplexity : 2902.166642741848
Sentence: but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .

Sentence: it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel 's family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best .

Sentence: `` in the first place , '' replied mr. gardiner , `` there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland . ''
Perplexity : 2552.5532346907844
Sentence: but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !
Perplexity : 2902.0454509860306
Sentence: and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road . ''
Perplexity : 2902.035711429099
Sentence: they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland . ''

Perplexity : 2902.0151502495823
Sentence: as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .
Perplexity : 2902.013512380942
Sentence: lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father 's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter .

Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain .

Sentence: into one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance .

Sentence: i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: had lydia 's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr. darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned .
Perplexity : 2730.364893003313
Sentence: from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink .

Sentence: i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing .

Perplexity : 2902.0322554651407

Sentence: no one but mrs. bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .
Perplexity : 2902.0714134562204
Sentence: these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: wickham 's affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia 's for him .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .
Perplexity : 2889.2870557958636

Sentence: are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Perplexity : 2786.9276040062095

Perplexity : 2902.0749902026782
Sentence: and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham .
Perplexity : 2902.068165003729
Sentence: if you 'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight .
Perplexity : 2902.09998019228
Sentence: not one party , or scheme , or any thing .
Perplexity : 2902.071423297656
Sentence: to be sure london was rather thin , but however the little theatre was open .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Perplexity : 2902.0217373392884
Sentence: and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .
Perplexity : 2902.2665641190983
Sentence: well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .
Perplexity : 2902.0714085376253
Sentence: but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .
Perplexity : 2902.062489906837
Sentence: however , i recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr. darcy might have done as well . ''

Sentence: certainly , '' said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; `` we will ask you no questions . ''
Perplexity : 2506.6694860592647
Sentence: on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .
Perplexity : 2902.088223969015
Sentence: but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .
Perplexity : 2843.8573574707834
Sentence: it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .
Perplexity : 2902.0476153364552
Sentence: conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .
Perplexity : 2902.0999888028773
Sentence: those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .
Perplexity : 2873.5148685092877
Sentence: `` you may readily comprehend , '' she added , `` what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .
Perplexity : 2646.0992613796993
Sentence: pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0131567911612
Sentence: `` not that i shall though , '' she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; `` and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . ''
Perplexity : 2797.6375375445214
Sentence: jane 's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .
Perplexity : 2902.034880925737
Sentence: elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .
Perplexity : 2676.663564631612
Sentence: she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .
Perplexity : 2902.0384551680118
Sentence: `` gracechurch street , sept. 6 .

Sentence: if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .
Perplexity : 2902.4441724119065
Sentence: your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .
Perplexity : 2902.035711429099
Sentence: but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit .
Perplexity : 2902.0454509860306
Sentence: mr. darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your 's seems to have been .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .
Perplexity : 2902.0769152620646
Sentence: he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: his character was to speak for itself .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .
Perplexity : 2851.3746096836903
Sentence: if he had another motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him .
Perplexity : 2903.043747815929
Sentence: he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .
Perplexity : 2875.4368647319734
Sentence: there is a lady , it seems , a mrs. younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .
Perplexity : 2902.067553224465
Sentence: she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .
Perplexity : 2902.0333306534867
Sentence: this mrs. younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .
Perplexity : 2805.579406105777
Sentence: but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .
Perplexity : 2865.507637022142
Sentence: at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction .
Perplexity : 2707.8483223223366
Sentence: they were in street .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .
Perplexity : 2902.2109896861048
Sentence: but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham .
Perplexity : 2780.873124854244
Sentence: she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .
Perplexity : 2902.124981159296
Sentence: since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .
Perplexity : 2902.055544126016
Sentence: he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia 's flight , on her own folly alone .
Perplexity : 2902.0131567911612
Sentence: he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .
Perplexity : 2902.052622989985
Sentence: he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: mr. darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .
Perplexity : 2902.0535673084437
Sentence: but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .
Perplexity : 2902.019229176446
Sentence: under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .
Perplexity : 2829.596019572162
Sentence: they met several times , for there was much to be discussed .
Perplexity : 2774.2675329204735
Sentence: wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: every thing being settled between them , mr. darcy 's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home .
Perplexity : 2902.0161276877575
Sentence: he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .
Perplexity : 2902.0161276877575
Sentence: he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .
Perplexity : 2902.166571022302
Sentence: on saturday he came again .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: they met again on sunday , and then i saw him too .
Perplexity : 2902.1110940980157
Sentence: it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn .
Perplexity : 2902.0555513018185
Sentence: but our visitor was very obstinate .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .
Perplexity : 2902.0769108456643
Sentence: he has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .
Perplexity : 2902.0999844975645
Sentence: they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .
Perplexity : 2840.8039347746812
Sentence: but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .
Perplexity : 2886.604663087557
Sentence: but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .
Perplexity : 2902.038458480308
Sentence: you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people .
Perplexity : 2902.538094444851
Sentence: his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .
Perplexity : 2829.5655127081036
Sentence: the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .
Perplexity : 2902.117639309315
Sentence: it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .
Perplexity : 2902.0588114606585
Sentence: perhaps there was some truth in this ; though i doubt whether his reserve , or anybody 's reserve , can be answerable for the event .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .
Perplexity : 2839.3001719150043
Sentence: when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .
Perplexity : 2902.0425480056515
Sentence: it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .
Perplexity : 2851.331897579706
Sentence: lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .
Perplexity : 2902.0999844978246
Sentence: if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen .
Perplexity : 2902.1874576129767
Sentence: he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday .
Perplexity : 2824.866165602047
Sentence: will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him .
Perplexity : 2829.6112062499064
Sentence: his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire .
Perplexity : 2902.0312474764287
Sentence: his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: but slyness seems the fashion .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park .
Perplexity : 2871.2779843766934
Sentence: a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: the children have been wanting me this half hour .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: your 's , very sincerely , `` m .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Perplexity : 2412.558581046057
Sentence: though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment 's deliberation , '' i am not . ''

Sentence: lady catherine seemed pleased .

Sentence: i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ?
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?
Perplexity : 2902.0454470715267
Sentence: allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged .
Perplexity : 2858.818567548895
Sentence: you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these .

Sentence: i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister 's infamous elopement .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i know it all ; that the young man 's marrying her , was a patched up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .
Perplexity : 2902.0624952893168
Sentence: and is such a girl to be my nephew 's sister ?
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: is her husband , is the son of his late father 's steward , to be his brother ?
Perplexity : 2902.0333306534867
Sentence: <s> heaven and earth !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: of what are you thinking ?

Sentence: are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: lady catherine rose also , and they turned back .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: her ladyship was highly incensed .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: unfeeling , selfish girl !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? ''

Sentence: `` lady catherine , i have nothing farther to say .
Perplexity : 2738.883626878862
Sentence: you know my sentiments . ''

Sentence: `` it is well .

Sentence: you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . ''
Perplexity : 2902.149973732427
Sentence: `` neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , '' replied elizabeth , `` have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .
Perplexity : 2658.967557510992
Sentence: no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment 's concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0816004181297
Sentence: this is your final resolve !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: <s> <s> very well .

Sentence: do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .
Perplexity : 2670.4781815875654
Sentence: i came to try you .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it i will carry my point . ''
Perplexity : 2902.071417146233
Sentence: in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , '' i take no leave of you , miss bennet .
Perplexity : 2807.154979704189
Sentence: i send no compliments to your mother .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: you deserve no such attention .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i am most seriously displeased . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .
Perplexity : 2843.930824121301
Sentence: she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself .
Perplexity : 2851.331897579706
Sentence: `` she did not choose it , '' said her daughter , `` she would go . ''
Perplexity : 2902.570790555593
Sentence: `` she is a very fine looking woman !
Perplexity : 2902.3999414368045
Sentence: and her calling here was prodigiously civil !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well .
Perplexity : 2902.457935681757
Sentence: she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you .
Perplexity : 2760.9444330706765
Sentence: i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0999931089123
Sentence: elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .
Perplexity : 2902.055546517409
Sentence: lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: it was a rational scheme to be sure !
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .
Perplexity : 2902.016665278857
Sentence: she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .
Perplexity : 2902.0312474764287
Sentence: and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .
Perplexity : 2878.1665523360216
Sentence: in revolving lady catherine 's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .
Perplexity : 2772.591561525568
Sentence: from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .
Perplexity : 2902.0108686492695
Sentence: she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
Perplexity : 2902.126707555258
Sentence: with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .
Perplexity : 2902.0212730086823
Sentence: in that case he would return no more .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: `` if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , '' she added , `` i shall know how to understand it .
Perplexity : 2523.8684440544976
Sentence: i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all . ''
Perplexity : 2902.019229176446
Sentence: the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs. bennet 's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .
Perplexity : 2878.2474408086855
Sentence: the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .
Perplexity : 2858.9279834524227
Sentence: `` lizzy , '' said he , `` i was going to look for you ; come into my room . ''
Perplexity : 2044.8335806391997
Sentence: she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .
Perplexity : 2902.0161276877575
Sentence: it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .
Perplexity : 2902.0454509860306
Sentence: he then said , '' i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .
Perplexity : 2819.435770375812
Sentence: as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .
Perplexity : 2902.0555513018185
Sentence: i did not know before , that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .
Perplexity : 2667.1154148863457
Sentence: let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: the colour now rushed into elizabeth 's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , '' you look conscious .
Perplexity : 2902.1082743923566
Sentence: young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .
Perplexity : 2809.4743501373086
Sentence: this letter is from mr .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` from mr. collins !
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: and what can he have to say ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.199989663251
Sentence: `` something very much to the purpose of course .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority .
Perplexity : 2902.0789280469608
Sentence: your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . ''
Perplexity : 2902.083311207017
Sentence: `` can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0454509860306
Sentence: `` this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman 's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0744534648184
Sentence: `` have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ?
Perplexity : 2902.1666475264465
Sentence: `` my motive for cautioning you , is as follows .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . ''
Perplexity : 2760.944403338733
Sentence: `` mr. darcy , you see , is the man !
Perplexity : 2902.142836050013
Sentence: now , lizzy , i think i have surprised you .
Perplexity : 2902.142836050013
Sentence: could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: mr. darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !
Perplexity : 2902.068165003729
Sentence: it is admirable ! ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .
Perplexity : 2797.0660086596085
Sentence: `` are you not diverted ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: pray read on . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .
Perplexity : 2882.8070296184205
Sentence: i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0357114290814
Sentence: `` mr. collins moreover adds , '' `` i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999823
Sentence: i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .
Perplexity : 2786.309459159468
Sentence: it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it .
Perplexity : 2902.0249979542255
Sentence: you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` that is his notion of christian forgiveness !
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte 's situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch .

Sentence: `` yes that is what makes it amusing .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !
Perplexity : 2902.079973547404
Sentence: nay , when i read a letter of his , i can not help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law .

Sentence: did she call to refuse her consent ? ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .
Perplexity : 2902.0555481122096
Sentence: elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .
Perplexity : 2902.071423297656
Sentence: it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .
Perplexity : 2902.0555513018185
Sentence: her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr. darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .
Perplexity : 2852.54700931556
Sentence: instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine 's visit .
Perplexity : 2902.0263136419812
Sentence: it was agreed to .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .
Perplexity : 2902.149982343173
Sentence: very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .
Perplexity : 2902.0277755179823
Sentence: now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , '' mr. darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding your 's .
Perplexity : 2843.6741830747837

Sentence: `` you must not blame my aunt .

Sentence: lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars .
Perplexity : 2858.873285969316
Sentence: let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . ''

Sentence: `` if you will thank me , '' he replied , `` let it be for yourself alone .

Perplexity : 2902.2915055633803
Sentence: elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .

Sentence: after a short pause , her companion added , `` you are too generous to trifle with me .
Perplexity : 2697.3308106356917
Sentence: my affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .
Perplexity : 2902.013512380942
Sentence: had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .

Sentence: they walked on , without knowing in what direction .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .
Perplexity : 2902.176384796219
Sentence: but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly . ''

Perplexity : 2902.019229176446
Sentence: but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .

Sentence: in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .

Sentence: she did not fear her father 's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .

Sentence: she was gone directly .

Perplexity : 2867.641489588763
Sentence: `` or in other words , you are determined to have him .

Sentence: you know not what you are about . ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
Perplexity : 2902.027774561112
Sentence: `` well , my dear , '' said he , when she ceased speaking , `` i have no more to say .
Perplexity : 2097.400108800944

Sentence: when her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .
Perplexity : 2902.055546517404

Perplexity : 2902.0238075705697
Sentence: nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .

Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .

Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs. bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .
Perplexity : 2856.2985754808437
Sentence: elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr. bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .
Perplexity : 2860.3496372053887
Sentence: `` i admire all my three sons in law highly , '' said he .

Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: `` my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .

Sentence: now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? ''
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977

Sentence: you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .
Perplexity : 2876.5759344445732
Sentence: there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: but make a virtue of it by all means .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .
Perplexity : 2882.570957449232
Sentence: `` because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . ''

Sentence: my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect .
Perplexity : 2902.0454509860306
Sentence: too much , i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for i ought not to have mentioned the subject ?

Sentence: this will never do . ''

Perplexity : 2901.9999999999977
Sentence: was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ?
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: or had you intended any more serious consequence ? ''
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005
Sentence: `` my real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me .
Perplexity : 2902.0208316135686
Sentence: my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made . ''

Perplexity : 2877.807085477561

Sentence: at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .

Sentence: he bore it however with admirable calmness .
Perplexity : 2902.0000000000005

Sentence: i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .
Perplexity : 2835.344545559243

Sentence: from the farther disadvantage of lydia 's society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs. wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .
Perplexity : 2901.9999999999823
Sentence: mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennet 's being quite unable to sit alone .
Perplexity : 2902.1850604026417

Perplexity : 2824.768925764044
Sentence: it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .
