Perplexity : 19.343883188985817
Sentence: by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother 's admiration .
Perplexity : 19.913327235942177
Sentence: it was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .
Perplexity : 18.729082827207932
Sentence: she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas .
Perplexity : 16.89771370850955
Sentence: `` it may perhaps be pleasant , '' replied charlotte , `` to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .

Perplexity : 19.148774378393885

Perplexity : 18.626702966910344
Sentence: `` but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .
Perplexity : 15.994863553257643
Sentence: if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . ''
Perplexity : 17.80246972289168

Perplexity : 15.269976770808611

Perplexity : 20.490989764526027
Sentence: when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . ''
Perplexity : 18.055463369601917
Sentence: `` your plan is a good one , '' replied elizabeth , `` where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it .
Perplexity : 17.773304597537237
Sentence: but these are not jane 's feelings ; she is not acting by design .
Perplexity : 19.567708878092063
Sentence: as yet , she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .
Perplexity : 17.01077001405497
Sentence: she has known him only a fortnight .
Perplexity : 18.9215696630456

Perplexity : 23.17874067938665
Sentence: this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . ''
Perplexity : 16.65184138460135
Sentence: `` not as you represent it .
Perplexity : 13.933572629250934
Sentence: had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal . ''
Perplexity : 24.883042845183287
Sentence: `` yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded . ''
Perplexity : 30.767239671567634
Sentence: `` well , '' said charlotte , `` i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .
Perplexity : 15.355030040313933
Sentence: happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .
Perplexity : 22.16379392800209
Sentence: if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .
Perplexity : 22.38506905698135
Sentence: they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . ''
Perplexity : 21.200916643983682
Sentence: `` you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .
Perplexity : 16.062183309617797

Perplexity : 16.061086168458857
Sentence: occupied in observing mr. bingley 's attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .
Perplexity : 20.194982458619748
Sentence: mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .
Perplexity : 18.04185259858541
Sentence: but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .
Perplexity : 22.220560194954935
Sentence: to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .
Perplexity : 39.47429621113395
Sentence: of this she was perfectly unaware ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .
Perplexity : 16.914748704030632
Sentence: he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .

Sentence: his doing so drew her notice .
Perplexity : 23.380052263761165

Perplexity : 15.876013900508053
Sentence: `` but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about .
Perplexity : 16.536037221690453
Sentence: he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him . ''
Perplexity : 20.500179220911356
Sentence: on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , '' did not you think , mr. darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? ''
Perplexity : 18.76345356594715

Sentence: if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . ''
Perplexity : 21.13909584363547
Sentence: and gravely glancing at mr. darcy , `` there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and i shall keep mine to swell my song . ''
Perplexity : 28.4002319032064
Sentence: her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .
Perplexity : 23.368615792508418
Sentence: after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .
Perplexity : 20.751030800701013
Sentence: mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .
Perplexity : 28.005065814043046
Sentence: elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .

Sentence: every savage can dance . ''
Perplexity : 28.01375478831837
Sentence: sir william only smiled .

Sentence: darcy . ''

Sentence: `` your humility , mr. bingley , '' said elizabeth , `` must disarm reproof . ''
Perplexity : 16.956904521301546
Sentence: `` nothing is more deceitful , '' said darcy , `` than the appearance of humility .
Perplexity : 16.12088139633376
Sentence: it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . ''
Perplexity : 23.76007236063557
Sentence: `` and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ? ''
Perplexity : 20.779977668254674
Sentence: `` the indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .
Perplexity : 24.14282538423776
Sentence: `` nay , '' cried bingley , `` this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .

Sentence: and yet , upon my honour , i believed what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment .
Perplexity : 14.32824087502572
Sentence: at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . ''
Perplexity : 22.662532140062048
Sentence: your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month . ''
Perplexity : 19.086173276512703
Sentence: `` you have only proved by this , '' cried elizabeth , `` that mr. bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .
Perplexity : 15.443377999228263
Sentence: you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself . ''
Perplexity : 19.678957052739296
Sentence: `` i am exceedingly gratified , '' said bingley , `` by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .
Perplexity : 20.34672023840175
Sentence: but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could . ''
Perplexity : 20.345975702183818
Sentence: `` upon my word i can not exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for himself . ''

Perplexity : 19.775998132546594
Sentence: allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . ''
Perplexity : 19.738841046258525

Perplexity : 19.11710862349961
Sentence: `` you appear to me , mr. darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .
Perplexity : 14.816742054743338
Sentence: a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .
Perplexity : 25.3260399057384
Sentence: i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr. bingley .
Perplexity : 18.37821940482513
Sentence: we may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .
Perplexity : 25.067729873227357
Sentence: but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? ''
Perplexity : 20.936145632986143
Sentence: `` will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? ''
Perplexity : 22.917160522362153
Sentence: `` by all means , '' cried bingley ; `` let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of .
Perplexity : 19.558057764276374
Sentence: i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , i should not pay him half so much deference .
Perplexity : 20.047870132754454
Sentence: i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do . ''
Perplexity : 19.339258757072646
Sentence: `` i see your design , bingley , '' said his friend .
Perplexity : 13.150650669977285
Sentence: `` perhaps i do .

Sentence: arguments are too much like disputes .
Perplexity : 40.32250611668485

Perplexity : 18.98945346559393

Perplexity : 17.08918034516722
Sentence: miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .
Perplexity : 24.261522198184366
Sentence: mrs. hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr. darcy 's eyes were fixed on her .
Perplexity : 24.88030771869599
Sentence: she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .
Perplexity : 18.078432720421407
Sentence: she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .
Perplexity : 20.676115599824463
Sentence: the supposition did not pain her .
Perplexity : 18.056248978855773
Sentence: she liked him too little to care for his approbation .
Perplexity : 20.25319517609254

Sentence: said she , `` i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply .
Perplexity : 14.897483807976446
Sentence: you wanted me , i know , to say 'yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .
Perplexity : 22.46800042191221
Sentence: i have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare . ''
Perplexity : 18.78317762975922
Sentence: `` indeed i do not dare . ''
Perplexity : 14.205258572330777
Sentence: elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .
Perplexity : 20.575644339476195
Sentence: he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .

Perplexity : 18.387862774030634

Perplexity : 20.122641628825342
Sentence: `` it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . ''

Sentence: at that moment they were met from another walk , by mrs. hurst and elizabeth herself .
Perplexity : 18.66032010555626
Sentence: `` i did not know that you intended to walk , '' said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .
Perplexity : 16.664359073145057
Sentence: `` you used us abominably ill , '' answered mrs. hurst , `` in running away without telling us that you were coming out . ''
Perplexity : 22.29881962502478
Sentence: then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself .
Perplexity : 19.91106750498528
Sentence: the path just admitted three .
Perplexity : 33.22331748790952
Sentence: mr. darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , '' this walk is not wide enough for our party .
Perplexity : 22.534703599196153
Sentence: we had better go into the avenue . ''
Perplexity : 21.786789070351585
Sentence: but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , '' no , no ; stay where you are .
Perplexity : 16.112115633397124

Sentence: when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .
Perplexity : 21.08015141970969
Sentence: their powers of conversation were considerable .
Perplexity : 25.549553000375184
Sentence: they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .
Perplexity : 29.652939974350254
Sentence: but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object .
Perplexity : 17.213509515472854
Sentence: miss bingley 's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .
Perplexity : 20.341703607388354
Sentence: he addressed himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation ; mr. hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was `` very glad ; '' but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley 's salutation .

Sentence: he was full of joy and attention .
Perplexity : 17.36794871596363

Perplexity : 29.448504604054854
Sentence: she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .
Perplexity : 16.06016914698422
Sentence: mr. hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .
Perplexity : 19.293657598863128
Sentence: darcy took up a book ; miss bingley did the same ; and mrs. hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother 's conversation with miss bennet .
Perplexity : 22.400064788890187
Sentence: miss bingley 's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr. darcy 's progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .
Perplexity : 23.545523388672063
Sentence: she could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on .
Perplexity : 16.56957628589745
Sentence: at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , `` how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !

Sentence: no one made any reply .
Perplexity : 21.411611570424903
Sentence: i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . ''
Perplexity : 19.17809281120719
Sentence: `` i should like balls infinitely better , '' she replied , `` if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .
Perplexity : 22.70895539804843
Sentence: it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . ''
Perplexity : 22.124757990612586

Sentence: `` i have not the smallest objection to explaining them , '' said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .
Perplexity : 14.90015248723761
Sentence: `` you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other 's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , i should be completely in your way ; and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire .

Perplexity : 20.087665276647822
Sentence: `` mr. darcy is not to be laughed at ! ''
Perplexity : 14.18261969293724
Sentence: `` that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance .
Perplexity : 17.2970339379086
Sentence: i dearly love a laugh . ''
Perplexity : 21.604239271341662
Sentence: the wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . ''

Sentence: mr. collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .

Perplexity : 22.65351332365119
Sentence: mrs. philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see mr. jones 's shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards mr. collins by jane 's introduction of him .

Perplexity : 19.051644528750153

Perplexity : 20.262384824976426
Sentence: when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr. collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mrs. philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine 's drawing rooms , and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper 's room .
Perplexity : 22.50784010214977
Sentence: in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in mrs. philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .
Perplexity : 22.563821861612396
Sentence: to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long .

Sentence: the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr. wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room .
Perplexity : 21.358126665925745
Sentence: mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .
Perplexity : 25.126573200779994
Sentence: with such rivals for the notice of the fair , as mr. wickham and the officers , mr. collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs. philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .

Perplexity : 19.800252632805062
Sentence: at first there seemed danger of lydia 's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular .
Perplexity : 27.408955345046046

Sentence: it is impossible for me to be impartial .
Perplexity : 17.105638201564208

Perplexity : 14.993550487070697
Sentence: we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .

Sentence: his father , miss bennet , the late mr. darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had ; and i can never be in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .

Sentence: mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .
Perplexity : 21.936836213089645
Sentence: the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .
Perplexity : 19.351821749682415

Perplexity : 27.969681014454324
Sentence: elizabeth 's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley 's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening 's amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance .
Perplexity : 21.451689530771507
Sentence: `` i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , '' said he , `` that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .

Perplexity : 22.031756030322864
Sentence: she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .
Perplexity : 16.716232375912185
Sentence: it now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .
Perplexity : 22.197225491383175
Sentence: if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once .
Perplexity : 17.85252434779324
Sentence: no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy .
Perplexity : 27.061087362564063
Sentence: even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia .
Perplexity : 22.876316748886897
Sentence: till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .
Perplexity : 24.21728775377898
Sentence: she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .
Perplexity : 20.18639606175824
Sentence: but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcy 's pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr. denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , '' i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . ''
Perplexity : 20.848389594457178
Sentence: this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .
Perplexity : 23.3676757302945
Sentence: attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .
Perplexity : 18.385237304491767
Sentence: she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .
Perplexity : 21.898558430675166
Sentence: but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .
Perplexity : 19.074093104828197
Sentence: the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .
Perplexity : 20.612241424812368
Sentence: mr. collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .
Perplexity : 24.010325912141756
Sentence: the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .
Perplexity : 21.130555196284266
Sentence: she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .
Perplexity : 18.183227756198775
Sentence: when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .
Perplexity : 17.718321003367535
Sentence: he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her .

Perplexity : 18.200703832081384
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .
Perplexity : 21.71648973911833
Sentence: they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .
Perplexity : 21.11788719526618
Sentence: he replied , and was again silent .
Perplexity : 13.26033893017648
Sentence: i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . ''
Perplexity : 18.32936582557094
Sentence: he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .
Perplexity : 15.921347830031833
Sentence: `` very well .
Perplexity : 11.99307317032615
Sentence: that reply will do for the present .
Perplexity : 16.04752783737895
Sentence: perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .

Sentence: but now we may be silent . ''
Perplexity : 17.090366553857855
Sentence: one must speak a little , you know .
Perplexity : 14.465664651829458
Sentence: it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . ''
Perplexity : 19.385620880423065
Sentence: `` are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? ''
Perplexity : 22.401920364919135
Sentence: `` both , '' replied elizabeth archly ; `` for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .
Perplexity : 20.553677691437834
Sentence: `` this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , '' said he .

Sentence: you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly . ''
Perplexity : 27.500387696317542
Sentence: `` i must not decide on my own performance . ''

Perplexity : 17.531187576033624
Sentence: she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , `` when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . ''

Sentence: the effect was immediate .
Perplexity : 18.943019664385837
Sentence: a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .
Perplexity : 20.504873645860545
Sentence: at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , '' mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . ''
Perplexity : 23.481993147773313
Sentence: `` he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , '' replied elizabeth with emphasis , `` and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . ''

Sentence: said he , with a look of doubt .
Perplexity : 12.624720433098364
Sentence: `` yes , always , '' she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , `` i remember hearing you once say , mr. darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .
Perplexity : 20.28825335676479

Perplexity : 13.66473484767198
Sentence: `` it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . ''
Perplexity : 23.25629929175249
Sentence: `` may i ask to what these questions tend ? ''
Perplexity : 25.935849661173556
Sentence: `` i am trying to make it out . ''
Perplexity : 15.09544171802805
Sentence: `` and what is your success ? ''
Perplexity : 15.239017038609909
Sentence: she shook her head .
Perplexity : 19.351687579419913
Sentence: `` i do not get on at all .
Perplexity : 13.227789875807568
Sentence: i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . ''
Perplexity : 24.567241767264964
Sentence: `` i can readily believe , '' answered he gravely , `` that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . ''
Perplexity : 19.106719271750567
Sentence: `` but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity . ''
Perplexity : 18.20403708575931
Sentence: `` i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , '' he coldly replied .
Perplexity : 21.800719151271224
Sentence: she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy 's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .
Perplexity : 21.877462775908718
Sentence: let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr. darcy 's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner .
Perplexity : 19.58873713230484
Sentence: i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame , that he can not bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .
Perplexity : 17.090545812020494
Sentence: i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ''
Perplexity : 21.302584456477785
Sentence: `` his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , '' said elizabeth angrily ; `` for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcy 's steward , and of that , i can assure you , he informed me himself . ''
Perplexity : 17.134041932118887
Sentence: `` i beg your pardon , '' replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .
Perplexity : 20.41946433970154
Sentence: `` excuse my interference .
Perplexity : 22.76167442356999
Sentence: it was kindly meant . ''
Perplexity : 18.744459818742616
Sentence: said elizabeth to herself .
Perplexity : 11.79399173751449
Sentence: `` you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .
Perplexity : 22.93036622310048
Sentence: i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr .
Perplexity : 21.50712433187829
Sentence: darcy . ''
Perplexity : 9.433799627716272
Sentence: she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley .
Perplexity : 22.212048416637437
Sentence: jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .
Perplexity : 21.756631580686527
Sentence: elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane 's being in the fairest way for happiness .
Perplexity : 21.493679650597034
Sentence: `` i want to know , '' said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister 's , `` what you have learnt about mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 15.33599953171893
Sentence: but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ''
Perplexity : 20.472069565597284
Sentence: `` no , '' replied jane , `` i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you .
Perplexity : 13.8758723823956
Sentence: mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister 's , mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
Perplexity : 18.974695082866198
Sentence: i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr. darcy 's regard . ''
Perplexity : 19.184576647063917
Sentence: `` mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself ? ''
Perplexity : 17.701313851167587
Sentence: `` this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 18.02054427980352
Sentence: i am perfectly satisfied .
Perplexity : 20.033466615749376
Sentence: but what does he say of the living ? ''
Perplexity : 16.01749717152953
Sentence: `` he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only . ''
Perplexity : 19.279928465535846
Sentence: `` i have not a doubt of mr. bingley 's sincerity , '' said elizabeth warmly ; '' but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
Perplexity : 18.126865917860048
Sentence: mr. bingley 's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before . ''
Perplexity : 19.86678794979124
Sentence: she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .
Perplexity : 19.724225732108767
Sentence: elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley 's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .
Perplexity : 20.238436952395258
Sentence: on their being joined by mr. bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr. collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
Perplexity : 21.673916427589077
Sentence: `` i have found out , '' said he , `` by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .
Perplexity : 16.462569846794175
Sentence: i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine .
Perplexity : 20.937838204747646
Sentence: how wonderfully these sort of things occur !
Perplexity : 46.922873947331325
Sentence: who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly !
Perplexity : 24.0570533457938
Sentence: my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . ''
Perplexity : 29.707763448936177
Sentence: `` you are not going to introduce yourself to mr .
Perplexity : 18.678285907781838
Sentence: darcy ? ''
Perplexity : 14.115369381324182
Sentence: `` indeed i am .
Perplexity : 12.844350469665997
Sentence: i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .
Perplexity : 26.33796781287818
Sentence: i believe him to be lady catherine 's nephew .
Perplexity : 16.91832711744898
Sentence: it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night . ''
Perplexity : 19.32728539832207
Sentence: elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr. darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .
Perplexity : 20.038852109094687
Sentence: you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty .
Perplexity : 23.29037818644475
Sentence: pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . ''
Perplexity : 27.696484849691117
Sentence: and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .
Perplexity : 23.859816982233397
Sentence: her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words `` apology , '' '' hunsford , '' and `` lady catherine de bourgh . ''
Perplexity : 17.816032507127012
Sentence: it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .
Perplexity : 17.772010894489025
Sentence: mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr. collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .
Perplexity : 22.472305674049757
Sentence: mr. collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr. darcy 's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .
Perplexity : 20.036557650932565
Sentence: mr. collins then returned to elizabeth .
Perplexity : 16.497212403388108
Sentence: he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine 's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .
Perplexity : 20.896825410650774
Sentence: it was really a very handsome thought .
Perplexity : 16.618938495473625
Sentence: upon the whole , i am much pleased with him . ''
Perplexity : 14.266651295115064
Sentence: as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .
Perplexity : 19.863307107470863
Sentence: she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley 's two sisters .
Perplexity : 20.9381218655933
Sentence: her mother 's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .
Perplexity : 22.15017363476998
Sentence: when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr. bingley .
Perplexity : 21.19469186323014
Sentence: it was an animating subject , and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .
Perplexity : 24.369274840098203
Sentence: his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .
Perplexity : 17.81157607793639
Sentence: it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane 's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .
Perplexity : 19.37907441705359
Sentence: it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .
Perplexity : 21.211162957394638
Sentence: she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .
Perplexity : 26.469739311534564
Sentence: in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother 's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy , who sat opposite to them .
Perplexity : 22.167774172940568
Sentence: her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .
Perplexity : 27.302311234704746
Sentence: `` what is mr. darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ?
Perplexity : 12.99631951649313
Sentence: i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . ''
Perplexity : 19.60359150074288
Sentence: `` for heaven 's sake , madam , speak lower .
Perplexity : 22.962576811984064
Sentence: what advantage can it be to you to offend mr. darcy ?
Perplexity : 17.724799291621235
Sentence: you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . ''
Perplexity : 19.320183541104026
Sentence: her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .
Perplexity : 22.706770417726496
Sentence: elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .
Perplexity : 27.534586580444184
Sentence: she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr. darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .
Perplexity : 19.590626448470022
Sentence: the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .
Perplexity : 35.4394606990282
Sentence: at length however mrs. bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .
Perplexity : 23.807438288665672
Sentence: elizabeth now began to revive .
Perplexity : 24.344531875752395
Sentence: by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .
Perplexity : 22.479050453769787
Sentence: elizabeth 's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .
Perplexity : 23.246145013823124
Sentence: mary 's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected .
Perplexity : 24.17210831298702
Sentence: she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley .
Perplexity : 17.241157144229327
Sentence: she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .
Perplexity : 22.93405436639234
Sentence: she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night .
Perplexity : 25.045368740540276
Sentence: he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , '' that will do extremely well , child .
Perplexity : 20.047482854277153
Sentence: you have delighted us long enough .
Perplexity : 22.45116075159125
Sentence: let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . ''
Perplexity : 20.92911478352458
Sentence: mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father 's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .
Perplexity : 18.34900613724931
Sentence: others of the party were now applied to .
Perplexity : 16.967552323206434
Sentence: `` if i , '' said mr. collins , `` were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .
Perplexity : 18.41453947938802
Sentence: i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .
Perplexity : 21.284178163720373
Sentence: the rector of a parish has much to do .
Perplexity : 17.598403980749474
Sentence: in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .
Perplexity : 22.413227918068493
Sentence: and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .
Perplexity : 24.492404066007214
Sentence: i can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . ''
Perplexity : 22.593241040286642
Sentence: and with a bow to mr. darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .
Perplexity : 17.329611209255326
Sentence: many stared .
Perplexity : 33.10653872967538
Sentence: to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .
Perplexity : 18.802751086405266
Sentence: that his two sisters and mr. darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .
Perplexity : 18.80193928897195
Sentence: she was teazed by mr. collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .
Perplexity : 18.572421335493985
Sentence: in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .
Perplexity : 20.593656575563035
Sentence: he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .
Perplexity : 17.747955590642835
Sentence: there was no arguing upon such a project .
Perplexity : 28.809007278694857
Sentence: she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy 's farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .
Perplexity : 22.909265712498556
Sentence: the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .
Perplexity : 20.37008137646114
Sentence: mrs. hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .
Perplexity : 23.953220533702616
Sentence: darcy said nothing at all .
Perplexity : 14.812533173045288
Sentence: mr. bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .
Perplexity : 17.592175480033735
Sentence: elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of `` lord , how tired i am ! ''
Perplexity : 25.44367661767432
Sentence: accompanied by a violent yawn .
Perplexity : 37.76745824861446
Sentence: bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .
Perplexity : 20.81466119973944
Sentence: of having another daughter married to mr. collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .
Perplexity : 17.83550985218299
Sentence: elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield .
Perplexity : 15.515643588014948
Sentence: the next day opened a new scene at longbourn .
Perplexity : 25.575555195308823
Sentence: mr. collins made his declaration in form .
Perplexity : 24.769834697868625

Perplexity : 20.375627265211072
Sentence: on finding mrs. bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , '' may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? ''
Perplexity : 17.8658968830586
Sentence: before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs. bennet instantly answered , '' oh dear !
Perplexity : 20.39036872622467
Sentence: yes certainly .
Perplexity : 21.970456006277214
Sentence: come , kitty , i want you up stairs . ''
Perplexity : 15.690762729965522
Sentence: and gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth called out , '' dear ma'am , do not go .
Perplexity : 19.416220576131842
Sentence: i beg you will not go .
Perplexity : 16.03548474228368
Sentence: mr. collins must excuse me .
Perplexity : 20.556289815773734
Sentence: he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear .

Perplexity : 11.013571229500787
Sentence: elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment 's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .
Perplexity : 25.620959612035406
Sentence: mrs. bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr. collins began .
Perplexity : 17.768524266102418
Sentence: `` believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .
Perplexity : 21.2311689480448
Sentence: you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother 's permission for this address .
Perplexity : 21.27019908953797

Sentence: to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .
Perplexity : 26.238741902101005
Sentence: mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs. bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .

Sentence: mr. collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .
Perplexity : 25.461007178519555

Sentence: i will speak to her about it myself directly .
Perplexity : 16.9231957816215
Sentence: `` pardon me for interrupting you , madam , '' cried mr. collins ; `` but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .
Perplexity : 19.99865710425092
Sentence: if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . ''

Perplexity : 13.72032947587055

Perplexity : 16.05534879997025
Sentence: elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs. bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .

Sentence: `` what do you mean , mr. bennet , by talking in this way ?
Perplexity : 15.749308633010617
Sentence: you promised me to insist upon her marrying him . ''
Perplexity : 20.035861369918777
Sentence: `` my dear , '' replied her husband , `` i have two small favours to request .

Sentence: i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . ''
Perplexity : 14.570750408127223
Sentence: she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns .
Perplexity : 23.301364950820656
Sentence: though her manner varied however , her determination never did .
Perplexity : 23.447907920775673
Sentence: mr. collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .
Perplexity : 20.98900585232802
Sentence: his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother 's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .
Perplexity : 23.253317431269156
Sentence: while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them .
Perplexity : 18.704567892368217

Perplexity : 21.579374845882512
Sentence: charlotte 's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth .
Perplexity : 18.70230719888252
Sentence: `` aye , there she comes , '' continued mrs. bennet , `` looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way .
Perplexity : 19.36719705811357
Sentence: but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .

Sentence: those who do not complain are never pitied . ''
Perplexity : 26.51604190280612
Sentence: her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .
Perplexity : 26.08871683915485
Sentence: she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr. collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , '' now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr. collins and me have a little conversation together . ''
Perplexity : 17.002957451531284
Sentence: elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr. collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .
Perplexity : 18.735087014421964
Sentence: in a doleful voice mrs. bennet thus began the projected conversation .
Perplexity : 32.70536749369368

Sentence: collins ! ''
Perplexity : 16.771040713451907
Sentence: far be it from me , '' he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , `` to resent the behaviour of your daughter .
Perplexity : 18.752929994266196
Sentence: resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned .
Perplexity : 23.5283106528601
Sentence: perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .
Perplexity : 28.320701061071187
Sentence: you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .
Perplexity : 23.124860871697802
Sentence: my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own .
Perplexity : 29.215346021617286
Sentence: but we are all liable to error .
Perplexity : 23.74948915518759
Sentence: my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise . ''
Perplexity : 21.061603362038387
Sentence: as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .
Perplexity : 21.72604211633182
Sentence: the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennet 's ill humour or ill health .
Perplexity : 31.00761402476152
Sentence: mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride .
Perplexity : 21.80562193986246

Perplexity : 18.945520740342378
Sentence: to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed .
Perplexity : 19.334336046555286
Sentence: `` i found , '' said he , `` as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr. darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . ''
Perplexity : 16.078953897633937
Sentence: she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .
Perplexity : 19.98731323917858
Sentence: soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately .
Perplexity : 17.569341361628982
Sentence: the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady 's fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister 's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .
Perplexity : 27.546158217037622
Sentence: jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .
Perplexity : 22.23331907095701
Sentence: when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , '' this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .

Sentence: the next was in these words .
Perplexity : 16.506092489629854
Sentence: `` i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .
Perplexity : 23.853654480825224
Sentence: i depend on you for that . ''
Perplexity : 12.236922293334617
Sentence: to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley 's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .
Perplexity : 19.089975731253503
Sentence: `` it is unlucky , '' said she , after a short pause , `` that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .
Perplexity : 15.747442966273166
Sentence: but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?

Perplexity : 20.291870251199263
Sentence: many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i despair .
Perplexity : 17.80731128330568

Perplexity : 22.28403417274519
Sentence: my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister 's partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman 's heart .

Perplexity : 18.870039506419307
Sentence: we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way .
Perplexity : 20.160519541303387
Sentence: but , my dearest jane , you can not seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend .

Perplexity : 19.616475835211112
Sentence: they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman 's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .
Perplexity : 22.47356247715719
Sentence: after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .

Perplexity : 22.00726816224095
Sentence: charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .
Perplexity : 19.677858110411538
Sentence: this was very amiable , but charlotte 's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of mr. collins 's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .
Perplexity : 21.984513958987815
Sentence: such was miss lucas 's scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon .
Perplexity : 20.693577948138472
Sentence: but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet .
Perplexity : 23.29092306224698
Sentence: he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday .
Perplexity : 22.39450508158338
Sentence: his reception however was of the most flattering kind .

Perplexity : 21.867179140032096
Sentence: in as short a time as mr. collins 's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .
Perplexity : 19.12505193827366
Sentence: the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .
Perplexity : 27.04843916400704
Sentence: sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .

Sentence: her reflections were in general satisfactory .
Perplexity : 24.26631361701145

Perplexity : 19.653353477516028
Sentence: the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .
Perplexity : 19.417202246931712
Sentence: elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .
Perplexity : 18.535135921619645
Sentence: a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .
Perplexity : 25.615786756487967
Sentence: `` my dear madam , '' he replied , `` this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . ''

Perplexity : 18.84638716691184
Sentence: you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . ''
Perplexity : 25.562462930367104
Sentence: risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . ''
Perplexity : 21.865855609875723
Sentence: `` believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire .

Perplexity : 19.347160648006316

Perplexity : 21.92463611999445
Sentence: but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .
Perplexity : 17.12322828616979
Sentence: miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before .
Perplexity : 21.32401226633607
Sentence: my dear charlotte , impossible ! ''
Perplexity : 18.159472297098294
Sentence: do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman 's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? ''
Perplexity : 20.104462930826784
Sentence: but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .
Perplexity : 19.97467695276505
Sentence: i am not romantic you know .

Sentence: i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr. collins 's character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . ''

Perplexity : 18.16604835056163
Sentence: it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .
Perplexity : 20.278286562073013
Sentence: the strangeness of mr. collins 's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .
Perplexity : 24.17829914440931
Sentence: she had always felt that charlotte 's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .
Perplexity : 22.471445482564995
Sentence: charlotte the wife of mr. collins , was a most humiliating picture !
Perplexity : 20.69088191212854
Sentence: and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .
Perplexity : 20.366418269612772
Sentence: with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , '' good lord !
Perplexity : 23.574962859397036
Sentence: sir william , how can you tell such a story ?
Perplexity : 23.368442270248476
Sentence: do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 19.13115198600324
Sentence: nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william 's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .
Perplexity : 25.507941596373616
Sentence: elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr. collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .
Perplexity : 20.275702765359114
Sentence: mrs. bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .
Perplexity : 27.165992628019318
Sentence: in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .
Perplexity : 19.525956658040162
Sentence: two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .
Perplexity : 20.479691418060035
Sentence: nothing could console and nothing appease her .
Perplexity : 25.230611216516166
Sentence: mr. bennet 's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !
Perplexity : 19.47080125090204
Sentence: jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .
Perplexity : 21.009462166073746
Sentence: between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .
Perplexity : 27.322853884359134
Sentence: her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .
Perplexity : 20.79811197052728

Perplexity : 22.305799095984202
Sentence: after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .
Perplexity : 22.37741093275661
Sentence: on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .
Perplexity : 16.29799276329529

Perplexity : 21.962098166795908
Sentence: such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley 's continued absence .
Perplexity : 20.704031882452202
Sentence: day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .
Perplexity : 26.973048483205673
Sentence: even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .
Perplexity : 21.407970037494998
Sentence: the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .
Perplexity : 20.006516222374692
Sentence: but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .
Perplexity : 21.574645560756196
Sentence: it needed all jane 's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .
Perplexity : 41.85521411851757
Sentence: mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .

Sentence: she complained bitterly of all this to her husband .
Perplexity : 21.19182153515729

Sentence: but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley 's being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .
Perplexity : 19.5137293003309
Sentence: it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane 's attractions .

Sentence: miss bennet accepted her aunt 's invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline 's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .

Perplexity : 19.590355237292506
Sentence: without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .
Perplexity : 18.45688828034875

Perplexity : 23.16595048638803
Sentence: do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .

Perplexity : 19.658641158515806
Sentence: after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer .

Perplexity : 21.31677962644842
Sentence: indeed , mr. darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . ''

Sentence: darcy smiled and said , `` you are perfectly right .

Perplexity : 21.049517442878862
Sentence: elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin 's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .
Perplexity : 20.706139814534783
Sentence: lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth 's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .

Perplexity : 19.79799661124196
Sentence: as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr. darcy , and mr. darcy only , entered the room .
Perplexity : 17.861408356902135
Sentence: he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .
Perplexity : 21.066791737913743
Sentence: they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .

Perplexity : 17.366296187908127
Sentence: `` i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .
Perplexity : 17.395853063055164
Sentence: `` if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .
Perplexity : 18.18939299222925
Sentence: but perhaps mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . ''
Perplexity : 18.03956872433653
Sentence: `` i should not be surprised , '' said darcy , `` if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . ''
Perplexity : 15.606407462419753
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer .
Perplexity : 18.449661972275933
Sentence: she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .
Perplexity : 16.25923348594864
Sentence: he took the hint , and soon began with , `` this seems a very comfortable house .
Perplexity : 17.606759824997702
Sentence: lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr. collins first came to hunsford . ''
Perplexity : 16.07118388772721
Sentence: `` i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . ''
Perplexity : 17.08537407138143
Sentence: `` mr. collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . ''
Perplexity : 20.297993375744134
Sentence: my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did .
Perplexity : 21.648637763653607
Sentence: she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . ''
Perplexity : 17.205403124776794
Sentence: `` it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . ''
Perplexity : 16.336967398142612
Sentence: `` an easy distance do you call it ?
Perplexity : 24.231039024550547
Sentence: it is nearly fifty miles . ''
Perplexity : 28.11472006337663
Sentence: little more than half a day 's journey .
Perplexity : 21.38807841068543
Sentence: yes , i call it a very easy distance . ''
Perplexity : 17.290570603618754
Sentence: `` i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , '' cried elizabeth .
Perplexity : 15.43708803825294
Sentence: `` i should never have said mrs. collins was settled near her family . ''
Perplexity : 16.904001080809728
Sentence: `` it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire .
Perplexity : 16.751757108585704
Sentence: any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far . ''
Perplexity : 17.177900074064727
Sentence: as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , '' i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .
Perplexity : 16.87233880412149
Sentence: the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .
Perplexity : 21.987224836756806
Sentence: mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . ''
Perplexity : 21.990361369041974
Sentence: mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , `` you can not have a right to such very strong local attachment .
Perplexity : 18.576851291994206
Sentence: you can not have been always at longbourn . ''
Perplexity : 14.445748878317387
Sentence: elizabeth looked surprised .
Perplexity : 21.464658516376186
Sentence: the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , '' are you pleased with kent ? ''
Perplexity : 21.263146750508426
Sentence: a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .
Perplexity : 22.517002206602548
Sentence: the tte  tte surprised them .
Perplexity : 36.633751859712014
Sentence: mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .

Sentence: `` what can be the meaning of this ! ''
Perplexity : 14.538942440034303
Sentence: said charlotte , as soon as he was gone .
Perplexity : 13.610054413855025
Sentence: `` my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . ''
Perplexity : 17.732690948497346
Sentence: but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte 's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .
Perplexity : 17.978055814537772
Sentence: all field sports were over .
Perplexity : 39.04902937990192
Sentence: within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen can not be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .
Perplexity : 20.22030578560521
Sentence: they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .
Perplexity : 22.13513570219989
Sentence: it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam 's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .
Perplexity : 20.382747498447696
Sentence: but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .
Perplexity : 17.149819690660816
Sentence: it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .
Perplexity : 20.446515577323563
Sentence: he seldom appeared really animated .
Perplexity : 39.8881029670458
Sentence: mrs. collins knew not what to make of him .
Perplexity : 14.518011934718087
Sentence: colonel fitzwilliam 's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .
Perplexity : 18.456472458421814
Sentence: she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success .
Perplexity : 20.280566347975235
Sentence: he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .
Perplexity : 18.706060522533907
Sentence: it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .
Perplexity : 21.746711863462703
Sentence: she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend 's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .
Perplexity : 19.03247373158278
Sentence: in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .
Perplexity : 23.647701204884324
Sentence: he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .
Perplexity : 20.65185897321888
Sentence: more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 24.196709859177947
Sentence: she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .
Perplexity : 23.106263717453807
Sentence: how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !
Perplexity : 28.16087261508018
Sentence: it seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .
Perplexity : 25.374475138454507
Sentence: his words seemed to imply it .
Perplexity : 23.151052169166533
Sentence: she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .
Perplexity : 20.574756538125055

Sentence: she was engaged one day as she walked , in re perusing jane 's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .
Perplexity : 21.087263867809966
Sentence: putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , '' i did not know before that you ever walked this way . ''
Perplexity : 18.17641057016731
Sentence: `` i have been making the tour of the park , '' he replied , `` as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage .

Sentence: are you going much farther ? ''
Perplexity : 21.71737447486131
Sentence: `` no , i should have turned in a moment . ''
Perplexity : 12.601803197078294
Sentence: and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .

Sentence: `` do you certainly leave kent on saturday ? ''
Perplexity : 25.216809033316295
Sentence: `` yes if darcy does not put it off again .
Perplexity : 20.429699331198247

Sentence: `` he likes to have his own way very well , '' replied colonel fitzwilliam .
Perplexity : 17.55671435963265
Sentence: `` but so we all do .
Perplexity : 13.05752589897627
Sentence: it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .
Perplexity : 18.56395357316142
Sentence: i speak feelingly .
Perplexity : 29.24142618205018
Sentence: a younger son , you know , must be inured to self denial and dependence . ''
Perplexity : 21.165191159201537
Sentence: `` in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .
Perplexity : 18.63337621594044
Sentence: now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ?
Perplexity : 22.339528652924447
Sentence: when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? ''
Perplexity : 22.837316702564344
Sentence: `` these are home questions and perhaps i can not say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature .
Perplexity : 22.75960112355366
Sentence: but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money .
Perplexity : 21.277283921809804
Sentence: younger sons can not marry where they like . ''
Perplexity : 27.229875786814215
Sentence: `` unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do . ''
Perplexity : 18.703331695220914
Sentence: `` our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . ''
Perplexity : 23.97760738652596
Sentence: `` is this , '' thought elizabeth , `` meant for me ? ''
Perplexity : 12.855485254666837
Sentence: and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , `` and pray , what is the usual price of an earl 's younger son ?
Perplexity : 20.207191073842356
Sentence: unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . ''
Perplexity : 27.486660368590655
Sentence: he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .
Perplexity : 17.364181611352763
Sentence: i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .
Perplexity : 21.333178915581627
Sentence: but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . ''
Perplexity : 14.894399597491843
Sentence: `` no , '' said colonel fitzwilliam , `` that is an advantage which he must divide with me .
Perplexity : 16.177527602867762
Sentence: i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy . ''
Perplexity : 15.917212207215343
Sentence: and pray what sort of guardians do you make ?
Perplexity : 25.452328239565343
Sentence: does your charge give you much trouble ?
Perplexity : 31.374119980482874
Sentence: young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . ''
Perplexity : 17.702218846610258
Sentence: as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .
Perplexity : 20.65987504199005
Sentence: i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .
Perplexity : 18.615963814684434
Sentence: i think i have heard you say that you know them . ''
Perplexity : 13.655974725199524
Sentence: `` i know them a little .
Perplexity : 12.306219223321776
Sentence: their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy 's . ''
Perplexity : 18.167735101609647
Sentence: `` care of him !
Perplexity : 15.637679018363672
Sentence: yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .
Perplexity : 25.434853500099685
Sentence: from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .
Perplexity : 19.667533075622867
Sentence: but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant .
Perplexity : 16.77427356600249
Sentence: it was all conjecture . ''
Perplexity : 14.257719625885318
Sentence: `` what is it you mean ? ''
Perplexity : 14.594276119609939
Sentence: `` it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady 's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . ''
Perplexity : 16.73749170719442
Sentence: `` you may depend upon my not mentioning it . ''
Perplexity : 18.514882705525583
Sentence: `` and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley .
Perplexity : 14.602002458278033
Sentence: what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . ''
Perplexity : 21.350074043762678
Sentence: `` did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? ''
Perplexity : 20.66610176191689
Sentence: `` i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . ''
Perplexity : 20.906648603440853
Sentence: `` and what arts did he use to separate them ? ''
Perplexity : 21.49350275535324
Sentence: `` he did not talk to me of his own arts , '' said fitzwilliam smiling .
Perplexity : 17.37636947024284
Sentence: `` he only told me , what i have now told you . ''
Perplexity : 13.75967084832282
Sentence: elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .
Perplexity : 20.21514203351965
Sentence: after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .
Perplexity : 21.249316558955314
Sentence: `` i am thinking of what you have been telling me , '' said she .
Perplexity : 14.206611660958291
Sentence: `` your cousin 's conduct does not suit my feelings .
Perplexity : 23.95558493027674
Sentence: why was he to be the judge ? ''
Perplexity : 14.478695688115621
Sentence: `` you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? ''
Perplexity : 26.486680771622318
Sentence: `` i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend 's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . ''
Perplexity : 17.491958348397418
Sentence: `` but , '' she continued , recollecting herself , `` as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .
Perplexity : 14.979290228705223
Sentence: it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . ''
Perplexity : 13.648346682141051
Sentence: `` that is not an unnatural surmise , '' said fitzwilliam , `` but it is lessening the honour of my cousin 's triumph very sadly . ''
Perplexity : 20.54967814533809
Sentence: this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr. darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .
Perplexity : 20.44993600827413
Sentence: there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .
Perplexity : 17.383087164680152
Sentence: it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .
Perplexity : 18.282914488134672
Sentence: there could not exist in the world two men , over whom mr. darcy could have such boundless influence .
Perplexity : 24.64983842502772
Sentence: that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr. bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .
Perplexity : 19.104609459009154
Sentence: he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .
Perplexity : 22.509864464371578
Sentence: `` to jane herself , '' she exclaimed , `` there could be no possibility of objection .
Perplexity : 14.863238090929277
Sentence: all loveliness and goodness as she is !
Perplexity : 22.46117163376465
Sentence: her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .
Perplexity : 21.58281742128482
Sentence: neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . ''
Perplexity : 23.71331186140412
Sentence: when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr. darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend 's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister .
Perplexity : 20.182794062575415
Sentence: the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .
Perplexity : 20.828023362445233
Sentence: when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent .
Perplexity : 19.582681718470955
Sentence: they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .
Perplexity : 33.755646770199704
Sentence: but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .
Perplexity : 19.98650561061992
Sentence: elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .
Perplexity : 26.420850488142406
Sentence: she could not think of darcy 's leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .
Perplexity : 17.467860583549673
Sentence: but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr. darcy walk into the room .
Perplexity : 18.77932349666681
Sentence: in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .
Perplexity : 22.787088886551707
Sentence: she answered him with cold civility .
Perplexity : 22.31454288541901
Sentence: he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .
Perplexity : 22.58546911558612
Sentence: elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .
Perplexity : 13.273270376140513
Sentence: after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , '' in vain have i struggled .
Perplexity : 21.30220419091024
Sentence: it will not do .
Perplexity : 11.240138583989811
Sentence: you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you . ''
Perplexity : 19.86160097350968
Sentence: elizabeth 's astonishment was beyond expression .
Perplexity : 23.208761217418427
Sentence: this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .
Perplexity : 18.508665877179062
Sentence: he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .
Perplexity : 18.56322352336145
Sentence: his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .
Perplexity : 24.270882495770827
Sentence: in spite of her deeply rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man 's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .
Perplexity : 21.05363040221855
Sentence: she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .
Perplexity : 16.959106238465225
Sentence: he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .
Perplexity : 19.473650767908328
Sentence: as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .
Perplexity : 16.165600357696288
Sentence: he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .
Perplexity : 25.581029254139334
Sentence: it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you .
Perplexity : 17.70497598429208
Sentence: but i can not i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .
Perplexity : 19.250494381149785
Sentence: i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .
Perplexity : 19.144778795492154
Sentence: the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . ''
Perplexity : 19.93695736997184
Sentence: mr. darcy , who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .
Perplexity : 25.585794009732524
Sentence: his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .
Perplexity : 27.560261970462562
Sentence: he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .
Perplexity : 19.536681627126125
Sentence: the pause was to elizabeth 's feelings dreadful .
Perplexity : 17.441326744813633
Sentence: at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , '' and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !
Perplexity : 15.749222771764472
Sentence: but it is of small importance . ''
Perplexity : 15.014891973103024
Sentence: `` i might as well enquire , '' replied she , `` why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?
Perplexity : 19.588341005465
Sentence: was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil ?
Perplexity : 20.77428422568936
Sentence: but i have other provocations .
Perplexity : 19.92993136115154
Sentence: you know i have .
Perplexity : 10.764805945611288
Sentence: had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? ''
Perplexity : 19.21792858420611
Sentence: as she pronounced these words , mr. darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .
Perplexity : 23.30700733136238
Sentence: `` i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .
Perplexity : 13.514030467088972
Sentence: no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .
Perplexity : 32.17554948779199
Sentence: you dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . ''
Perplexity : 20.258809789062198
Sentence: she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .
Perplexity : 27.530993076255246
Sentence: he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .
Perplexity : 21.43560372067157
Sentence: `` can you deny that you have done it ? ''
Perplexity : 16.020042016128286
Sentence: she repeated .
Perplexity : 15.693002707524109
Sentence: with assumed tranquillity he then replied , `` i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success .
Perplexity : 20.5010727434049
Sentence: towards him i have been kinder than towards myself . ''
Perplexity : 21.48331857252356
Sentence: elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .
Perplexity : 25.83671958071377
Sentence: `` but it is not merely this affair , '' she continued , `` on which my dislike is founded .
Perplexity : 16.56354661896474
Sentence: long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .
Perplexity : 17.49336646277096
Sentence: your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 25.570065088974175
Sentence: on this subject , what can you have to say ?
Perplexity : 14.544470544916072
Sentence: or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? ''
Perplexity : 31.218336205395207
Sentence: `` you take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns , '' said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .
Perplexity : 21.42214795471793
Sentence: `` who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? ''
Perplexity : 20.878176743059814
Sentence: `` his misfortunes ! ''
Perplexity : 19.032065740093692
Sentence: repeated darcy contemptuously ; `` yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . ''
Perplexity : 22.269890146463965
Sentence: `` and of your infliction , '' cried elizabeth with energy .
Perplexity : 16.71471450705112
Sentence: `` you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .
Perplexity : 25.732575092092254
Sentence: you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .
Perplexity : 17.61812633987744
Sentence: you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .
Perplexity : 21.267543647595915
Sentence: you have done all this !
Perplexity : 17.25920730975599
Sentence: and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . ''
Perplexity : 21.647889462107702
Sentence: `` and this , '' cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , '' is your opinion of me !
Perplexity : 16.552836121043924
Sentence: this is the estimation in which you hold me !
Perplexity : 20.84567962904433
Sentence: i thank you for explaining it so fully .
Perplexity : 23.462227435001854
Sentence: my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !
Perplexity : 29.831730645251387
Sentence: but perhaps , '' added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , `` these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .
Perplexity : 23.50440669773585
Sentence: but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .
Perplexity : 24.26935176316204
Sentence: nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .
Perplexity : 18.416457641854617
Sentence: they were natural and just .
Perplexity : 17.349737305356633
Sentence: could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?
Perplexity : 21.88083106976091
Sentence: to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? ''
Perplexity : 25.118586253334403
Sentence: elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , '' you are mistaken , mr. darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . ''
Perplexity : 19.967416641016857
Sentence: `` from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry . ''
Perplexity : 20.313566191923908
Sentence: `` you have said quite enough , madam .
Perplexity : 15.682918765624668
Sentence: i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .
Perplexity : 16.434044051261466

Sentence: it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .
Perplexity : 30.26570558552074
Sentence: but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr. wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .
Perplexity : 20.953661839156506

Sentence: she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr. darcy 's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .

Perplexity : 18.35683723304862
Sentence: wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .
Perplexity : 22.554470740079264
Sentence: but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .

Sentence: if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your 's , i can only say that i am sorry .

Sentence: your sister i also watched .
Perplexity : 23.672645514039587
Sentence: if you have not been mistaken here , i must have been in an error .
Perplexity : 16.594164052795612
Sentence: your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .
Perplexity : 24.954360131590388
Sentence: if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .
Perplexity : 19.713669423383276
Sentence: but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister 's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .
Perplexity : 19.52610257749906
Sentence: that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .
Perplexity : 25.867852192292
Sentence: my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .
Perplexity : 20.826493452463446
Sentence: but there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .
Perplexity : 23.837551814614265
Sentence: these causes must be stated , though briefly .
Perplexity : 32.46180370023874

Sentence: pardon me .
Perplexity : 20.823076741948125

Sentence: i described , and enforced them earnestly .
Perplexity : 24.07879579809919

Sentence: but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .
Perplexity : 24.222077897390943
Sentence: to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .
Perplexity : 16.84753032661911
Sentence: to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .
Perplexity : 19.776146674904062
Sentence: i can not blame myself for having done thus much .
Perplexity : 23.08083781051359

Perplexity : 20.10886714254769
Sentence: i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .
Perplexity : 14.880213338421996
Sentence: that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .
Perplexity : 21.84674950662844
Sentence: it is done , however , and it was done for the best .
Perplexity : 11.83472382312545
Sentence: on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .
Perplexity : 17.268902126060834

Perplexity : 22.584613626274813
Sentence: of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .
Perplexity : 24.412990620184473
Sentence: mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .
Perplexity : 20.465986523527082
Sentence: my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education .
Perplexity : 22.278551011381865
Sentence: my father was not only fond of this young man 's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .
Perplexity : 20.18319131053356
Sentence: as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner .
Perplexity : 16.031205668221553
Sentence: the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr. darcy could not have .
Perplexity : 21.52988543458139
Sentence: here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell .
Perplexity : 21.18428536135803
Sentence: but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .
Perplexity : 25.582651674061538
Sentence: it adds even another motive .
Perplexity : 35.00552355460032
Sentence: my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .
Perplexity : 21.44702316062476
Sentence: there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .
Perplexity : 25.838140120594588
Sentence: his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr. wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .
Perplexity : 24.546773537964913
Sentence: i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman .
Perplexity : 16.14161001447761
Sentence: the business was therefore soon settled .
Perplexity : 19.27947132849002

Perplexity : 20.1087773386352
Sentence: all connection between us seemed now dissolved .
Perplexity : 38.667201401669985
Sentence: i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town .
Perplexity : 18.376116622123025
Sentence: in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .
Perplexity : 23.754143287757927
Sentence: for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .
Perplexity : 18.379689912267644
Sentence: his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .
Perplexity : 16.84733671713557
Sentence: he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions .
Perplexity : 20.459821969329465
Sentence: his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .
Perplexity : 18.647455926325115
Sentence: after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .
Perplexity : 22.672716128557038
Sentence: how he lived i know not .
Perplexity : 15.943710032598156
Sentence: but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
Perplexity : 31.15712914435156
Sentence: i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .
Perplexity : 23.554510116914315
Sentence: having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy .
Perplexity : 21.11487314514474
Sentence: about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .
Perplexity : 22.325619543456295
Sentence: she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .
Perplexity : 16.849571332780247
Sentence: i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .
Perplexity : 22.0367161161198
Sentence: you may imagine what i felt and how i acted .
Perplexity : 18.978133645789374
Sentence: regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge .
Perplexity : 21.71612078879343
Sentence: his revenge would have been complete indeed .
Perplexity : 26.908421220336464
Sentence: this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham .
Perplexity : 21.576256618817713
Sentence: you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .
Perplexity : 23.394528579830826
Sentence: but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .
Perplexity : 17.990243357418056
Sentence: for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .
Perplexity : 23.426964324649834
Sentence: i will only add , god bless you .
Perplexity : 24.14574278519613
Sentence: `` fitzwilliam darcy . ''
Perplexity : 13.864325458142027
Sentence: if elizabeth , when mr. darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .
Perplexity : 18.04683500060355
Sentence: but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .
Perplexity : 20.188777700497884
Sentence: her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .
Perplexity : 19.318131491732757
Sentence: with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .
Perplexity : 20.295643100920365
Sentence: with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield .
Perplexity : 21.332070093570415
Sentence: she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .
Perplexity : 20.519501900291765
Sentence: he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .
Perplexity : 21.418085596615267
Sentence: it was all pride and insolence .
Perplexity : 18.69875655882834
Sentence: but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .
Perplexity : 24.20869290531452
Sentence: astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .
Perplexity : 20.237018318371174
Sentence: she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , `` this must be false !
Perplexity : 24.525312451968574
Sentence: and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .
Perplexity : 18.718621084767815
Sentence: the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .
Perplexity : 18.532376066139193
Sentence: so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .
Perplexity : 20.278896226621427
Sentence: but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham 's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .
Perplexity : 23.047525838683946
Sentence: she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success .
Perplexity : 27.268820133870907
Sentence: on both sides it was only assertion .
Perplexity : 26.706853654820552
Sentence: again she read on .
Perplexity : 16.37763532751951
Sentence: but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr. darcy 's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .
Perplexity : 24.73520554189216
Sentence: the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr. wickham 's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .
Perplexity : 23.010020733011498
Sentence: of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself .
Perplexity : 17.585235578552037
Sentence: as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .
Perplexity : 16.093580380129893
Sentence: his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .
Perplexity : 17.73991344468103
Sentence: she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .
Perplexity : 27.999616661696592
Sentence: but no such recollection befriended her .
Perplexity : 24.970763867154783
Sentence: she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .
Perplexity : 21.57519089695775
Sentence: after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .
Perplexity : 24.37470218084242
Sentence: but , alas !
Perplexity : 21.38352576034883
Sentence: at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin 's corroboration .
Perplexity : 20.893379177081954
Sentence: many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .
Perplexity : 23.502778197609963
Sentence: she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .
Perplexity : 19.80036559066167
Sentence: she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .
Perplexity : 20.40121353335912
Sentence: how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !
Perplexity : 25.304699936009534
Sentence: his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .
Perplexity : 25.28471070204917
Sentence: every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of mr. darcy , she could not but allow that mr. bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .
Perplexity : 24.291652284999504
Sentence: that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling .
Perplexity : 21.79157995962221
Sentence: that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr. bingley , was incomprehensible .
Perplexity : 21.361138047463072
Sentence: she grew absolutely ashamed of herself .
Perplexity : 26.777693808626346
Sentence: of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .

Sentence: on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?
Perplexity : 18.826574135692933
Sentence: the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .

Sentence: i am not equal to it .
Perplexity : 11.95327729804581

Sentence: we must not make him desperate . ''
Perplexity : 19.273511494562293
Sentence: the tumult of elizabeth 's mind was allayed by this conversation .
Perplexity : 22.800848648956414
Sentence: but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .
Perplexity : 32.521036064719404

Sentence: `` and then , '' said she , `` if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .

Sentence: she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .
Perplexity : 25.94151128519084
Sentence: having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .
Perplexity : 21.79536058161945
Sentence: `` well , lizzy , '' said mrs. bennet one day , `` what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane 's ?
Perplexity : 16.536434569715354
Sentence: for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .
Perplexity : 15.97863396854076
Sentence: but i can not find out that jane saw any thing of him in london .
Perplexity : 16.529725822323424
Sentence: well , he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .
Perplexity : 17.57324328510232
Sentence: there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . ''
Perplexity : 16.40536195524549
Sentence: `` i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more . ''
Perplexity : 16.5134435271172
Sentence: `` oh , well !
Perplexity : 16.172128693169242
Sentence: it is just as he chooses .
Perplexity : 19.563255934980564
Sentence: though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .
Perplexity : 16.318608670468276
Sentence: well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . ''
Perplexity : 17.04974551176361
Sentence: but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .
Perplexity : 18.5928181784567
Sentence: `` well , lizzy , '' continued her mother soon afterwards , `` and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ?
Perplexity : 16.839792616467506
Sentence: well , well , i only hope it will last .
Perplexity : 13.243099021674812
Sentence: and what sort of table do they keep ?
Perplexity : 21.71901186061479
Sentence: charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say .
Perplexity : 24.901505412972895
Sentence: if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .
Perplexity : 18.948746094424447
Sentence: `` no , nothing at all . ''
Perplexity : 10.674791285120813
Sentence: `` a great deal of good management , depend upon it .
Perplexity : 19.741440420987008

Sentence: and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead .
Perplexity : 17.718346985506052
Sentence: they look upon it quite as their own , i dare say , whenever that happens . ''
Perplexity : 18.8745511512448
Sentence: `` it was a subject which they could not mention before me . ''
Perplexity : 14.377662205080284
Sentence: `` no .
Perplexity : 9.465720721156712
Sentence: it would have been strange if they had .
Perplexity : 16.111976087164635
Sentence: but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .
Perplexity : 18.337514921028145
Sentence: well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .
Perplexity : 17.72068833301989
Sentence: the first week of their return was soon gone .
Perplexity : 18.374000801833382
Sentence: the second began .

Perplexity : 18.395283633500018
Sentence: the dejection was almost universal .

Sentence: `` how can you be smiling so , lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 16.419904934472914
Sentence: their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .

Perplexity : 21.098091061380018
Sentence: she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy 's objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .
Perplexity : 19.974050174710523
Sentence: a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two .
Perplexity : 21.579358422466008
Sentence: the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs. forster , the delight of mrs. bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described .
Perplexity : 17.252646981685665
Sentence: `` i can not see why mrs. forster should not ask me as well as lydia , '' said she , `` though i am not her particular friend .

Sentence: i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older . ''
Perplexity : 16.174273166942115
Sentence: in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned .
Perplexity : 17.98556772926424
Sentence: she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia 's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .
Perplexity : 20.6179916714553
Sentence: he heard her attentively , and then said , '' lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ''
Perplexity : 20.298526513570955
Sentence: `` if you were aware , '' said elizabeth , `` of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia 's unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair . ''

Sentence: `` indeed you are mistaken .
Perplexity : 17.92864612448203
Sentence: it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining .
Perplexity : 17.341510178457778
Sentence: our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia 's character .
Perplexity : 24.716404589958948
Sentence: excuse me for i must speak plainly .
Perplexity : 24.39338857471091
Sentence: if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .
Perplexity : 18.25023335580461
Sentence: her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .
Perplexity : 17.956389437954627
Sentence: a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .

Sentence: in this danger kitty is also comprehended .
Perplexity : 29.529321977640922
Sentence: vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled !
Perplexity : 27.06346305030654
Sentence: my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? ''

Perplexity : 20.8584566811405
Sentence: every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .
Perplexity : 21.700625400268514

Perplexity : 24.273939699727084

Perplexity : 19.891566591790987
Sentence: nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .
Perplexity : 19.461367948893276

Perplexity : 26.490428111852403

Perplexity : 23.44016663780985

Sentence: she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .
Perplexity : 19.79540284265868
Sentence: and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ?
Perplexity : 20.661293188185162
Sentence: that he should even speak to her was amazing !
Perplexity : 19.708955383181934

Perplexity : 18.032549904475033
Sentence: never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .

Sentence: she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .
Perplexity : 14.009024378750627
Sentence: they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .
Perplexity : 20.43457215085055
Sentence: her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr. darcy then was .
Perplexity : 19.35543243555736
Sentence: she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .
Perplexity : 15.14509018798611
Sentence: perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .
Perplexity : 18.793929913280234
Sentence: at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .
Perplexity : 18.28204465574151
Sentence: they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .
Perplexity : 25.300777755551294
Sentence: mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .
Perplexity : 21.950641416438458
Sentence: with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .
Perplexity : 20.06322123520253
Sentence: it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .
Perplexity : 24.787597754152603
Sentence: they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it .
Perplexity : 27.910367693714146
Sentence: elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .
Perplexity : 21.303064285299772
Sentence: her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .
Perplexity : 19.60626487959151
Sentence: whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth 's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .
Perplexity : 18.97498411543009
Sentence: for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .
Perplexity : 22.63487580148608
Sentence: this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .
Perplexity : 23.951385195421906
Sentence: mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .
Perplexity : 17.01468110194093
Sentence: this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .
Perplexity : 20.31793734621753
Sentence: `` what will be his surprise , '' thought she , `` when he knows who they are !
Perplexity : 15.140239196568311
Sentence: he takes them now for people of fashion . ''
Perplexity : 21.086227031724693

Perplexity : 20.895801286112157
Sentence: elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .
Perplexity : 14.578366112902577
Sentence: it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .
Perplexity : 19.033419638398275
Sentence: she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .
Perplexity : 20.29167703180187
Sentence: the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .
Perplexity : 23.526676127723093
Sentence: mrs. gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .
Perplexity : 20.999805002776746
Sentence: elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .
Perplexity : 16.057552460165486
Sentence: her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , `` why is he so altered ?
Perplexity : 18.822880426635216
Sentence: from what can it proceed ?
Perplexity : 23.78625946076945
Sentence: it can not be for me , it can not be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .
Perplexity : 16.327600259807717
Sentence: my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .
Perplexity : 23.137259894605613
Sentence: it is impossible that he should still love me . ''
Perplexity : 16.535140722278367
Sentence: after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .
Perplexity : 25.67377585118045
Sentence: it originated in mrs. gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth 's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband 's .
Perplexity : 21.798002262148916
Sentence: mr. darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .
Perplexity : 17.254000267216785
Sentence: after a short silence , the lady first spoke .
Perplexity : 18.793879525042392
Sentence: she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected `` for your housekeeper , '' she added , `` informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . ''
Perplexity : 17.994225328453588
Sentence: he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .
Perplexity : 20.434817918424447
Sentence: her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingley 's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .
Perplexity : 22.136916103917944
Sentence: she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .
Perplexity : 17.469380810337242
Sentence: they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought .
Perplexity : 20.37673048448175
Sentence: elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .
Perplexity : 16.270051685898427
Sentence: his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .
Perplexity : 15.763498062512838
Sentence: they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .
Perplexity : 19.550210743042882
Sentence: he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .
Perplexity : 20.0795406624199
Sentence: at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .
Perplexity : 14.798860632434378
Sentence: she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .
Perplexity : 21.740824965555916
Sentence: at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance .
Perplexity : 26.159741413005662

Perplexity : 31.837531370211252
Sentence: on mr. and mrs. gardiner 's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .
Perplexity : 20.845237632344396
Sentence: mr. darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .
Perplexity : 21.485864938471327

Perplexity : 19.614702409667323
Sentence: `` he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , '' said her uncle .
Perplexity : 17.131665669640075
Sentence: `` there is something a little stately in him to be sure , '' replied her aunt , `` but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .
Perplexity : 15.65327619433753
Sentence: i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , i have seen nothing of it . ''
Perplexity : 16.599652341784186
Sentence: `` i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .
Perplexity : 15.983262554446648
Sentence: it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention .
Perplexity : 18.228996078410507
Sentence: his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling . ''
Perplexity : 16.681103618743883
Sentence: `` to be sure , lizzy , '' said her aunt , `` he is not so handsome as wickham ; or rather he has not wickham 's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .
Perplexity : 15.329959298386388
Sentence: but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? ''
Perplexity : 17.369721359696488
Sentence: elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .
Perplexity : 18.53867474649462
Sentence: `` but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , '' replied her uncle .
Perplexity : 18.080412701344866
Sentence: `` your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . ''
Perplexity : 21.05221067752841
Sentence: elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .
Perplexity : 17.95811960283236
Sentence: `` from what we have seen of him , '' continued mrs. gardiner , `` i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham .
Perplexity : 17.02233169255501
Sentence: and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .
Perplexity : 19.339262167463573
Sentence: but to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character !
Perplexity : 19.72872666176769
Sentence: i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .
Perplexity : 35.210695238697774
Sentence: but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue . ''
Perplexity : 17.899563733656407
Sentence: elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham 's so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire .
Perplexity : 19.049127699698445
Sentence: in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .
Perplexity : 21.97519164301067
Sentence: mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .
Perplexity : 21.353254400280694

Perplexity : 22.495220873875613
Sentence: it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .
Perplexity : 22.78728757960204
Sentence: when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .

Sentence: she certainly did not hate him .

Perplexity : 21.294258405662326
Sentence: the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .

Sentence: she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .
Perplexity : 19.08587998115238
Sentence: it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy 's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .

Perplexity : 22.935343133321883
Sentence: convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley 's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady 's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed .

Perplexity : 16.833983239530387
Sentence: georgiana 's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .

Sentence: mrs. gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .
Perplexity : 14.940955615268388
Sentence: it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .
Perplexity : 21.453691673277095
Sentence: miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .
Perplexity : 22.514735803531597
Sentence: elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .
Perplexity : 17.883628419584824
Sentence: this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .
Perplexity : 19.778823233649277
Sentence: her own thoughts were employing her .
Perplexity : 23.44963209892171

Sentence: she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .
Perplexity : 18.90459400624252
Sentence: the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .
Perplexity : 25.663548340403228
Sentence: there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .
Perplexity : 22.716780957413373
Sentence: while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .
Perplexity : 19.93923934684598
Sentence: he had been some time with mr. gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .
Perplexity : 17.588723124999582
Sentence: no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .
Perplexity : 21.318543425354946
Sentence: in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley 's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over .
Perplexity : 21.911314977279858
Sentence: miss darcy , on her brother 's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .

Sentence: they must be a great loss to your family . ''
Perplexity : 15.480748447480108
Sentence: in darcy 's presence she dared not mention wickham 's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment 's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .
Perplexity : 28.219918298490445
Sentence: while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .
Perplexity : 24.73258941011479
Sentence: not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy 's meditated elopement .
Perplexity : 23.86223089791774
Sentence: to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley 's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .
Perplexity : 20.196900895734938
Sentence: he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .
Perplexity : 21.15709519080614
Sentence: elizabeth 's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .
Perplexity : 22.040072173953103
Sentence: their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress .
Perplexity : 22.08037202727144
Sentence: her brother 's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .
Perplexity : 22.454969298793984
Sentence: when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .
Perplexity : 17.8608598307325
Sentence: `` how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy , '' she cried ; `` i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .
Perplexity : 18.55526109242948
Sentence: she is grown so brown and coarse !
Perplexity : 38.81529204133435
Sentence: louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again . ''
Perplexity : 18.321121561164084
Sentence: however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .
Perplexity : 27.45325290801411
Sentence: `` for my own part , '' she rejoined , `` i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her .
Perplexity : 15.901491199687603
Sentence: her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .
Perplexity : 22.87408324199565
Sentence: they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . ''
Perplexity : 20.21980161668646
Sentence: persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .
Perplexity : 21.68758922825476
Sentence: he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , '' i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , 'she a beauty !
Perplexity : 20.551183973248346
Sentence: i should as soon call her mother a wit . '
Perplexity : 21.889402991896905
Sentence: but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . ''
Perplexity : 17.452367995971592
Sentence: `` yes , '' replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , `` but that was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . ''
Perplexity : 16.802179711237397

Perplexity : 23.070790298839352

Perplexity : 17.89803886645557
Sentence: elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .
Perplexity : 20.516441330495518
Sentence: elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill. they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .
Perplexity : 20.28545154032639

Perplexity : 23.92809836972455

Perplexity : 29.70357527231507
Sentence: but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .
Perplexity : 24.468415367097567

Perplexity : 16.383120650712666

Perplexity : 19.417236346700236
Sentence: mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant 's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .

Perplexity : 21.21279409143095
Sentence: but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .
Perplexity : 23.25424460010155
Sentence: had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .

Perplexity : 16.68969441722842
Sentence: `` in the first place , '' replied mr. gardiner , `` there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland . ''
Perplexity : 16.867466597328818
Sentence: they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .
Perplexity : 20.086176757955013
Sentence: it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland . ''

Sentence: but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good .
Perplexity : 19.121509411660902

Sentence: from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .
Perplexity : 20.878647788053826
Sentence: the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .

Perplexity : 17.43615581695676

Perplexity : 23.01490345202067

Perplexity : 18.28883399183186
Sentence: they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .
Perplexity : 20.988560619394818
Sentence: but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .
Perplexity : 22.635441713632265
Sentence: but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .
Perplexity : 16.65092076901305
Sentence: you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people .

Sentence: the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .
Perplexity : 16.109239458327963
Sentence: it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .
Perplexity : 16.502469018573734
Sentence: but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .

Perplexity : 21.045369788300437
Sentence: his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire .
Perplexity : 16.776978050640626
Sentence: his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .
Perplexity : 21.699354556323108
Sentence: i thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name .

Perplexity : 25.48743023425724
Sentence: the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sister 's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !
Perplexity : 22.8854309002398
Sentence: he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .
Perplexity : 22.65229339183395
Sentence: her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .
Perplexity : 14.337279796432611
Sentence: but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .
Perplexity : 22.541323113063605
Sentence: brother in law of wickham !
Perplexity : 22.11689442264705

Perplexity : 22.400341815755574
Sentence: it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .

Perplexity : 25.939953494383694

Sentence: elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .

Perplexity : 27.243670612395043

Sentence: for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well .
Perplexity : 15.540275352353968
Sentence: she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you .
Perplexity : 18.57992228464358
Sentence: i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? ''
Perplexity : 14.693607275552306

Perplexity : 21.56516531243216
Sentence: lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr. darcy .
Perplexity : 23.818249958142495
Sentence: it was a rational scheme to be sure !
Perplexity : 18.868879885254067
Sentence: but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .
Perplexity : 17.114943491823233
Sentence: she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .
Perplexity : 19.35789326496669
Sentence: and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .
Perplexity : 21.54057780076826
Sentence: in revolving lady catherine 's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .
Perplexity : 22.474518611856933
Sentence: she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
Perplexity : 19.3119845555299
Sentence: if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .
Perplexity : 20.110087844035977
Sentence: in that case he would return no more .
Perplexity : 16.616821617617187
Sentence: lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way .
Perplexity : 19.51687666514008
Sentence: i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .
Perplexity : 22.21745784724931
Sentence: if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all . ''
Perplexity : 21.159305161783717
Sentence: the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs. bennet 's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .
Perplexity : 18.515985961106853
Sentence: the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .

Perplexity : 12.869841835045582
Sentence: she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .
Perplexity : 18.726224788766388
Sentence: it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .

Perplexity : 18.13020582185174

Sentence: let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . ''
Perplexity : 21.54380781969781
Sentence: the colour now rushed into elizabeth 's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , '' you look conscious .
Perplexity : 21.330298269951186
Sentence: this letter is from mr .
Perplexity : 19.75407700056337

Sentence: `` something very much to the purpose of course .
Perplexity : 15.517499851399691

Sentence: your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . ''
Perplexity : 20.730792753711395
Sentence: `` can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? ''
Perplexity : 19.454604156940093
Sentence: `` this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .
Perplexity : 27.666373381715758
Sentence: yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman 's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . ''
Perplexity : 21.280663594150198
Sentence: but now it comes out . ''
Perplexity : 17.04385227678381
Sentence: `` my motive for cautioning you , is as follows .
Perplexity : 19.567580644965965
Sentence: we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . ''
Perplexity : 20.453725289633333
Sentence: `` mr. darcy , you see , is the man !
Perplexity : 11.544612889235454
Sentence: could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?
Perplexity : 22.816268485618597
Sentence: mr. darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !
Perplexity : 19.188411314404725
Sentence: it is admirable ! ''
Perplexity : 20.90673919355651
Sentence: elizabeth tried to join in her father 's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .

Perplexity : 19.377997396041135

Perplexity : 15.248342127304989

Perplexity : 20.975426082993582
Sentence: `` mr. collins moreover adds , '' `` i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .
Perplexity : 25.27795642668086
Sentence: i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .
Perplexity : 22.307816990282603
Sentence: it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it .
Perplexity : 18.336859446879533
Sentence: you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . ''

Sentence: `` that is his notion of christian forgiveness !
Perplexity : 28.32933926281826

Sentence: but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .
Perplexity : 14.034422150645778
Sentence: you are not going to be missish , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .
Perplexity : 20.284317989952147
Sentence: for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? ''

Sentence: cried elizabeth , `` i am excessively diverted .

Sentence: but it is so strange ! ''
Perplexity : 16.973109217865577
Sentence: `` yes that is what makes it amusing .
Perplexity : 21.513398679159025
Sentence: had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !
Perplexity : 22.562953169472383
Sentence: much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr. collins 's correspondence for any consideration .
Perplexity : 22.51457483764791
Sentence: and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ?
Perplexity : 19.84485317276257
Sentence: elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .
Perplexity : 16.889945586229985
Sentence: it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .
Perplexity : 16.381760368623848
Sentence: her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr. darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .
Perplexity : 18.603570634729074
Sentence: instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine 's visit .
Perplexity : 19.835107597952895
Sentence: the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out .
Perplexity : 19.31979585598757
Sentence: bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .
Perplexity : 17.000578624553047
Sentence: they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other .
Perplexity : 17.55489764772956
Sentence: very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .
Perplexity : 21.471576384776093
Sentence: they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .
Perplexity : 22.960059955728116
Sentence: now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , '' mr. darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding your 's .
Perplexity : 16.671717964664875
Sentence: i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .
Perplexity : 26.317771902568374
Sentence: ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it .
Perplexity : 18.668899669687004
Sentence: were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express . ''
Perplexity : 15.646423267884318
Sentence: `` i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , '' replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , `` that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .
Perplexity : 16.808754704105
Sentence: i did not think mrs. gardiner was so little to be trusted . ''
Perplexity : 15.688990921919238
Sentence: lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars .
Perplexity : 17.328414527857365
Sentence: let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . ''
Perplexity : 19.58931604305586
Sentence: that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny .
Perplexity : 19.53717438619544
Sentence: but your family owe me nothing .
Perplexity : 23.119039325712286
Sentence: elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .
Perplexity : 18.956311805118833
Sentence: after a short pause , her companion added , `` you are too generous to trifle with me .
Perplexity : 20.028201878955926
Sentence: my affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . ''
Perplexity : 21.911713210007445
Sentence: elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .
Perplexity : 20.179982519170142
Sentence: the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .
Perplexity : 20.61893201128273
Sentence: had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .
Perplexity : 17.859010898544977
Sentence: there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .
Perplexity : 14.094849783106271
Sentence: she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship 's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give .
Perplexity : 21.123960074257532
Sentence: but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .
Perplexity : 23.525064181859687
Sentence: `` it taught me to hope , '' said he , `` as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .
Perplexity : 15.132105722144296
Sentence: i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly . ''
Perplexity : 18.363137247192814
Sentence: elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , `` yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .
Perplexity : 17.781221539833048
Sentence: after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . ''
Perplexity : 20.854542537379473
Sentence: `` what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ?
Perplexity : 14.51167811798677
Sentence: it was unpardonable .
Perplexity : 16.674998720338557
Sentence: i can not think of it without abhorrence . ''
Perplexity : 14.86144237942901
Sentence: `` we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , '' said elizabeth .
Perplexity : 20.27922324572267

Perplexity : 19.12036537966006
Sentence: `` i can not be so easily reconciled to myself .
Perplexity : 17.76204692489341
Sentence: the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .
Perplexity : 16.052533244390084
Sentence: your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : 'had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner . '
Perplexity : 27.718846868836184
Sentence: you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice . ''
Perplexity : 18.211628667648935
Sentence: `` i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .
Perplexity : 22.642899302704194
Sentence: i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . ''
Perplexity : 16.024878090886613
Sentence: `` i can easily believe it .
Perplexity : 15.7945254581295
Sentence: you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did .
Perplexity : 21.116811550955298
Sentence: do not repeat what i then said .
Perplexity : 18.213473929906733
Sentence: these recollections will not do at all .
Perplexity : 20.148985927347002
Sentence: i assure you , that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it . ''
Perplexity : 15.746507251980887
Sentence: darcy mentioned his letter .
Perplexity : 18.870115502524712
Sentence: `` did it , '' said he , `` did it soon make you think better of me ?
Perplexity : 13.114938553610543
Sentence: did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? ''
Perplexity : 18.464493149926447
Sentence: `` i knew , '' said he , `` that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .
Perplexity : 13.389251692590546
Sentence: i hope you have destroyed the letter .
Perplexity : 17.715987524595686
Sentence: there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again .
Perplexity : 18.326478523086948
Sentence: `` the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . ''
Perplexity : 20.44319361672243
Sentence: `` when i wrote that letter , '' replied darcy , `` i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . ''
Perplexity : 19.552582279219603
Sentence: `` the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .
Perplexity : 14.374242256939555
Sentence: the adieu is charity itself .
Perplexity : 36.47292132675621
Sentence: but think no more of the letter .
Perplexity : 12.842477641598641
Sentence: the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten .
Perplexity : 19.016568522314202
Sentence: you must learn some of my philosophy .
Perplexity : 21.835800801381566
Sentence: think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . ''
Perplexity : 22.93368387795358
Sentence: `` i can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .
Perplexity : 16.669231814488587
Sentence: your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .
Perplexity : 21.128823685714718
Sentence: but with me , it is not so .
Perplexity : 9.956467482292307

Perplexity : 18.66153061236822
Sentence: i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .
Perplexity : 21.580987338355808

Perplexity : 17.93856358305981
Sentence: in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , `` go to your father , he wants you in the library . ''

Sentence: `` lizzy , '' said her father , `` i have given him my consent .

Sentence: you know not what you are about . ''
Perplexity : 13.490449383770258
Sentence: elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
