stephen dedalus stepped up followed him wearily
halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as
he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and
lathered cheeks and neck
he was raving all night about a black panther stephen said
a tolerant
smile curled his lips

he went to the desk near the window pulled in his chair twice and read
off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter
stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence
but prompt ventilation of this
allimportant question

where cranly led me to get rich quick hunting his winners among the
mudsplashed brakes amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek
of the canteen over the motley slush
by a woman who
was no better than she should be
in
every sense of the word take the bull by the horns
and they are
the signs of a nations decay
their eyes knew their years of wandering and patient knew the

his eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor
on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board
never put a dress on her back like it

pleasure or pain is it
she folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch
yes mrs breen said

his pale galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove
and harry of six wives daughter
stephen turned boldly in his chair
she was entitled to her widows dower
at common law
he lifted his
hands and said all we can say is that life ran very high in those
days lovely
just mix up a mixture of
theolologicophilolological
accusations
are made in anger
but a man who holds so
tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will
hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls
his wife
or his jennyass buck mulligan antiphoned

fabulous artificer

it repeats itself again when he is near the grave when his married
daughter susan chip of the old block is accused of adultery

cuck mulligan clucked lewdly
he laughed unmarried at eglinton johannes of arts a bachelor
john eclecticon doubly smiled
chin chon eg lin ton
good practical catholic useful at mission time
a onelegged sailor swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his

conmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came
from baconflitches and ample cools of butter
in america those things were continually
happening
he walked there reading in the evening and heard the
cries of the boys lines at their play young cries in the quiet
evening
he should have read that before lunch

tom rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his

old russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem turned

gloating on a stolen hoard
the whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the

very large and wonderful and keeps famous time
down baldynoddle or well wool your
wool
then our friends writ is not worth the paper it is printed on ben
dollard said
damned irish language
language of our forefathers
still i shouldnt wonder if he did after all

want to be imposed on
as he strode past mr blooms dental windows the sway of his dustcoat
brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards
having buffeted a thewless body
from the sidemirrors two mourning
masters dignam gaped silently
gob thatd be a good pucking match to see
one of them mots that do be in the packets of fags stoer
smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found
out
no sandymount tram
the
blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt blooming
end to it
i hope he is in purgatory now because
he went to confession to father conroy on saturday night
the viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the
metropolis
over against dame gate tom rochford and nosey flynn watched the

he passed a blind stripling opposite broadbents

sight nearly left my eyes when i saw him land out a quid
bergan says bob doran waking up
hanging
says joe
yes says alf
it was
then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the
defunct and the reply was we greet you friends of earth who are
still in the body
so of course bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him

give us the paw
and sure more be token the lout i am told was in
powers after the blenders round in cope street going home footless
in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the
samples in the bloody establishment
a posse of dublin
metropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in person
maintained order in the vast throng for whom the york street brass and
reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on
their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from
the cradle by speranzas plaintive muse
afraid hell bite you

and they rose in their seats those twelve of iar and they
swore by the name of him who is from everlasting that they would do his
rightwiseness
those are nice things says the citizen coming over here to ireland
filling the country with bugs
and our wool that was sold in rome in the time of juvenal and our flax
and our damask from the looms of antrim and our limerick lace our
tanneries and our white flint glass down there by ballybough and our
huguenot poplin that we have since jacquard de lyon and our woven silk
and our foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the carmelite
convent in new ross nothing like it in the whole wide world
yes sir says terry
here you are citizen says joe
gerty macdowell loves the boy that has the bicycle

the milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and rising in the golden poop
the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off
forward with all sail set the spinnaker to larboard

did i kill him says he or what
when lo there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld
the chariot wherein he stood ascend to heaven
a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life
always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her
cherryripe red lips a girl lovable in the extreme
butter and cream
how sad to poor gertys ears
and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful
virgin most merciful
the colours were done something lovely
she often looked at them
dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own
arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and
thought about those times because she had found out in walkers
pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the
halcyon days what they meant
and when cissy came up edy
asked her the time and miss cissy as glib as you like said it was
half past kissing time time to kiss again
she had loved him better than he knew
no no not that
she would try to understand him because men
were so different
but gerty was adamant
no
shoals of them every evening poured
out of offices
i am all clean come and dirty me
kiss and delighted to kiss to see you
picking holes in
each others appearance
dark devilish appearance

all the dirty things i made her say

certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like

accept to die like the rest and pass away
bloom there for a languor he had but was now better he having
dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame mrs moll with red slippers
on in a pair of turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be
for a change and mistress purefoy there that got in through pleading
her belly and now on the stools poor body two days past her term
the midwives sore put to it and cannot deliver she queasy for a bowl of
riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very
heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks they
say but god give her soon issue

singular communed the guest with himself the
wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them that
the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the
seminaries of such frivolity that the mere acquisition of academic

levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise
