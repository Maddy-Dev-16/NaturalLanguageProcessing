however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters
do not you want to know who has taken it
how so
in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of
impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him
myself how can you be so teazing
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation
if i
had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on
him
but i knew i should
persuade you at last
what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was
shut
his brotherinlaw mr hurst merely
looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance of his having ten thousand a year
such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves
you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr
darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet
he could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room
you never see a fault in any body
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but
though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs hurst who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her
upon my wordwell that was very decided indeedthat does seem as
ifbut however it may all come to nothing you know
another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him
if i were you
vanity and pride are different
things though the words are often used synonimously
in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more
affection than she feels
she has known him only a fortnight
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance
what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my
conversation with colonel forster
that is a question which mr darcy only can answer
do
you often dance at st
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow
nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most
convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliners shop just over the way
with the officers
i could hardly keep my countenance
why must she be scampering about the
country because her sister had a cold
her hair so untidy so blowsy
i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper
that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes
neglect
upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get
pemberley by purchase than by imitation
and so extremely
accomplished for her age
this she would not hear of but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled
that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet
were not decidedly better
mr jones says we must not think of moving her
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society
but that
gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing
at all
he only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which
you must acknowledge to be true
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies
but however he did not
i have already told her so once by your desire
cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable
he leaves out half his words and blots the rest
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty
but i am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a
circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i
could
by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not
forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more
weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of
mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended and therefore checked her laugh
mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed
elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed
on her
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her was still more strange
they are in the same profession you know only in different
lines
they could describe an
entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit
mr
hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep
darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same
and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss
bennet
her figure was elegant and she walked wellbut darcy at
whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious
miss bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked
up
you are safe from me
mrs bennet
wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold againbut their
father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really
glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle
well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and
nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn
as a clergyman moreover i
     feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
     all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds
     i flatter myself that my present overtures of goodwill are highly
     commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the
     entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side
     and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch
i cannot be
     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
     amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to
     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amendsbut
     of this hereafter
if you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family monday november 18th by four oclock and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday
     senight following which i can do without any inconvenience as
     lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you
must confess
chapter xiv
mr collins was eloquent in her praise
has she any family
i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more
about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town
mrs
bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias
interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would
resume his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront seated himself at another table with mr bennet and prepared
for backgammon
in his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told
elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore
was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their
walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and
go
her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject
drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i
understand
you could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myselffor i have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy
as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmlyi have spent
four days in the same house with him and i think him very
disagreeable
noit is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy
he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most
intimate confidential friend
how can they suit each otherdo you
know mr
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a
card table they must take their chance of these thingsand happily i
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object
mr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins for
a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh
elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr
wickham and herself
the two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation
she was not the better pleased with his
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something moreit now first
struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors
the two first dances however brought a return of distress
they were dances of mortification
the moment of her release from
him was ecstacy
he replied and was again silent
very wellthat reply will do for the presentperhaps by and bye i
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
onesbut now we may be silent
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to meryton
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir
what congratulations will
then flow in
said he
with a look of doubt
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion
to be secure of judging properly at first
darcy
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcys farther notice
though often standing within a very short distance of her quite
disengaged he never came near enough to speak
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four
months
on finding
mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon
after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words

may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth
when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning
you can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken
but depend upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall be
brought to reason
mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar
is it true
from this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parentsyour mother will never see you
again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again
if you do
aye there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcerned
as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided
she can have her own waybut i tell you what miss lizzy if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way
you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is deadi shall not be able to keep
youand so i warn youi have done with you from this very dayi
told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you
again and you will find me as good as my word
those who do not complain are never
pitied
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission
from your daughters lips instead of your own
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of
whom we shall deprive you
to
put me on my guard
miss bingley i am sure cannot
but
my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on
tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the
chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedlyand after an awkward pause
they returned to the rest of the family
it
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match
sir william how can you tell such a storydo not you know
that mr collins wants to marry lizzy
on the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husbandit was very strange that he should come
to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesomeshe hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss
darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for
the strength of his attachment
whenever charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that
they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead
in three volumes
my dear jane
we must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured
but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brothers
when is your turn to come
he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably
the netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well
bred and agreeable
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject
but do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us
about ten or a dozen years ago
before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of derbyshire to which he belonged
my dear aunt this is being serious indeed
the house furniture neighbourhood and
roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most
friendly and obliging
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley
i do not at
     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but
     if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should
     be deceived again
yours c

this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she
considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least
chapter iv
absence had increased her desire of seeing
charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr collins
all was joy and
kindness
it was reasonable however to
hope that they would not continue long
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe
no lizzy that is what i do not choose
what felicity
what are men
to rocks and mountains
chapter v


every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to
elizabeth and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and
telling again what had been already written and when it closed
elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding
and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but
their visit to rosings
mr collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many
servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them
she enquired into charlottes domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice
as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry
aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had
known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had
a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours
charlotte had seen
them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running
into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding

i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of
elizabeth after the health of her family
colonel fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had
only seen at church
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not
scruple to call out

what is that you are saying fitzwilliam
i
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music
i often
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired
without constant practice
i am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a
part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit
mr
darcy you cannot deny the fact
perfectly soi thank you
the far and the near must be relative and depend on many
varying circumstances
these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have
experienced many hardships of that nature
and pray what sort of guardians do you make
elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with
indignation
if his own vanity however did not mislead him
he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that
jane had suffered and still continued to suffer
but
this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently
affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the
room
he sat down for a few moments and
then getting up walked about the room
the pause was to elizabeths feelings
dreadful
on this subject what can you have to
say
you have reduced
him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty
you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert
and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room
is your opinion of me
will you do me the honour of reading that letter
wickhamwilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
     my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who
     had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity
     to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could
     be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparisonbut
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
     bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in
     future secured when the following account of my actions and their
     motives has been readif in the explanation of them which is
     due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which
     may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorrythe
     necessity must be obeyedand farther apology would be absurdi
     had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with
     others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other
     young woman in the countrybut it was not till the evening of the
     dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a
     serious attachmenti had often seen him in love beforeat that
     ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made
     acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that
     bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general
     expectation of their marriage
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds
he had some intention he added of studying the law
     and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein
for
     about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the
     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied
     to me again by letter for the presentation
his
attachment to rosings certainly increases
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of
spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon she added

but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer
you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our
original plan
it is highly improper
mr collins was gratified and with a more smiling
solemnity replied

it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably
our situation
with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast
in
truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble
parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of
compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was
obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect
unconcern oh
theres for you
she says lizzy had better have taken mr
collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it
their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases
came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects
which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs bennet was
doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other
retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice
rather louder than any other persons was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her
for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr
darcys but you shall do as you chuse
and poor mr darcy
such an openness and gentleness in his manner
what is your own opinion
well lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion now of
this sad business of janes
there is no talk of his
coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every
body too who is likely to know
well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the
collinses live very comfortable do they
yes yes
and so i suppose they often
talk of having longbourn when your father is dead
how can you be smiling so
lizzy
but papa is so
disagreeable
he heard her attentively and then said

lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances
indeed you are mistaken
if you my dear
father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment
at any rate she cannot grow
many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life
it was not
in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them
for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more
serious tone that he is improved in essentials
there was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention while she added

when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from
knowing him better his disposition was better understood
but mr bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter
arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent
they gradually ascended for
half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by
pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which
the road with some abruptness wound
its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned
elizabeth was delighted
her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother
elizabeth could not help saying it is
very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance
they stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family
it might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again
the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their
relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore
it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions
her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when mr bingleys name had been last mentioned
between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was
not very differently engaged
it was more
than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such
attention
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes
they could
not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference
to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognised it for mr darcy
such a
change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but
gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means
unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined
the fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon
miss darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard
she wished she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether
she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine
yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that
was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance
my dear lizzy they must
     have passed within ten miles of us
this
unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure
of seeing you at pemberley today
upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your uncles
opinion
but does lydia know nothing of this
when first
he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all
were
it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by
its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during
the whole of the journey
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say
that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i
particularly begged him to do
my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i
could most wish for
and above all things keep mr bennet from
fighting
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality
especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry
no i believe not
does he
know his real character
i shall send for my
     clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
     packed up
he could not speak a word for full ten
minutes
he was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with
the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family
if there
were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining
such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and
mother both of whom had been dead many years
it was possible however
that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more
information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the
application was a something to look forward to
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept
up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living
mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day which was saturday
it would have spared her she thought
one sleepless night out of two
chapter vii
have you heard from my uncle
we have judged it best that my
     niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will
     approve
i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done
i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred ayear during my life and fifty after i am
gone
cried elizabeth as soon as they
were by themselves
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up
stairs together
my dear dear lydia
but the
clothes the wedding clothes
ring the bell
kitty for hill
if he had not had a family of his own i and my children
must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have
ever had any thing from him except a few presents
one days delay she observed
would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual
mrs hill began instantly to express her joy
mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that
instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for
the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived
him
but how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture
they came
when i went away i am sure
i had no more idea of being married till i came back again
yesthere is nothing in that
you are so strange
we were
married you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were in
that parish
and there was my
aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon
not one party or scheme or any thing
however i
recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the
wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well
on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power by running away
he called it therefore his duty to step
     forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on
     by himself
she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery
     and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be
     found
he did not
     leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a
     gentleman had called on business
but at last your uncle was forced
     to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece
     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it
     which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your
     letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an
     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give
     the praise where it was due
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner
     representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and
     all the unhappiness she had brought on her family
said he
as he joined her
did you ever hear darcy mention the
circumstance when you were in kent
you have
not these two or three years perhaps
my sisters may write to me
i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with
ones friends
but however he is very welcome to
come to netherfield if he likes it
and who knows what may happen
but that is nothing to us
mr bingley arrived
mrs bennet through the assistance of servants
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could
there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be
la
let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early
enough for expectation
i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have
seen it in the papers
to miss lydia bennet without there being a
syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing
bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations
yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing
how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her
former lover
when they repaired to the
diningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by
her sister
is there one among the sex who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman
and quite alone
nothing child nothing
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at
such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it
elizabeth was forced to go
every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their
visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he
turned to his daughter and said

jane i congratulate you
my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you
talking of
then addressing her daughter oh
i was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing
he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen
he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his
modesty
you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short
silence
i never heard that it was
you
may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer
now what have you to say
while in their cradles we planned
the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to
the family
if mr darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make
another choice
you will
be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him
i am ashamed of you
though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady
catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a
moments deliberation

i am not
allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as
frivolous as the application was illjudged
she
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs
your daughter
elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after
her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate
may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land
now lizzy i think i have
surprised you
i thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned
ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it
after abusing you so
abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations
for though your
accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour
to you at the time had merited the severest reproof
i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it
when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly
calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit
but think no more of the letter
you must learn some
of my philosophy
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind
you blamed me for coming
i must ask whether you were surprised
from the former
and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to
him
she had only to say in
reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own
knowledge
she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing
else awakened a suspicion of the truth
oh yes
it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am
sure it will be too much for kitty
so do not put yourself to
inconvenience
are you out of your senses to be
accepting this man
it will save me a world of trouble
and economy
i shall offer to pay him tomorrow he will rant and storm about
his love for you and there will be an end of the matter
but before she had been three minutes in her own room
her mother followed her
and a
special licence
but the morrow
passed off much better than she expected for mrs bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak
to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark
her deference for his opinion
and so was i
but
i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected
but now suppose as much as you chuse give a
     loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible
     flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me
     actually married you cannot greatly err
dear sir

     i must trouble you once more for congratulations
she wrote even
to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her
former professions of regard
he bore it however with admirable calmness
it had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to
their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills
